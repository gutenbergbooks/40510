<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Most of the tales in this volume were written prior
to the publication of &ldquo;Uncle Silas,&rdquo; which is, perhaps,
the novel by which my father is best known. All
the stories, with the exception of &ldquo;The Watcher,&rdquo;
were included in &ldquo;The Purcell Papers,&rdquo; edited by
Mr. Alfred Perceval Graves after my father&rsquo;s death,
and published by Messrs. Bentley.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to point out that the central
idea in the story entitled &ldquo;Passage in the Secret
History of an Irish Countess&rdquo; is embodied in &ldquo;Uncle
Silas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When &ldquo;The Purcell Papers&rdquo; were appearing in
<cite>The Dublin University Magazine</cite> my father supplied
the following note, which was reproduced by Mr.
Graves in his edition of the book:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;The residuary legatee of the late Francis Purcell, who has
the honour of selecting such of his lamented old friend&rsquo;s manuscripts
as may appear fit for publication, in order that the lore
which they contain may reach the world before scepticism and
utility have robbed our species of the precious gift of credulity,
and scornfully kicked before them, or trampled into annihilation
those harmless fragments of picturesque superstition which it is
our object to preserve, has been subjected to the charge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
dealing too largely in the marvellous; and it has been half insinuated
that such is his love for <em>diablerie</em>, that he is content to
wander a mile out of his way in order to meet a fiend or a
goblin, and thus to sacrifice all regard for truth and accuracy to
the idle hope of affrighting the imagination, and thus pandering
to the bad taste of his reader. He begs leave, then, to take
this opportunity of asserting his perfect innocence of all the
crimes laid to his charge, and to assure his reader that he never
pandered to his bad taste, nor went one inch out of his way to
introduce witch, fairy, devil, ghost, or any other of the grim
fraternity of the redoubted Raw-head-and-bloody-bones. His
province touching these tales has been attended with no
difficulty and little responsibility; indeed, he is accountable for
nothing more than an alteration in the names of persons mentioned
therein, when such a step seemed necessary, and for an
occasional note, whenever he conceived it possible innocently
to edge in a word. These tales have been <em>written down</em> by the
Rev. Francis Purcell, P.P., of Drumcoolagh; and in all the
instances, which are many, in which the present writer has had
an opportunity of comparing the manuscript of his departed
friend with the actual traditions current amongst the families
whose fortunes they pretend to illustrate, he has uniformly
found that whatever of supernatural occurred in the story, so
far from being exaggerated by him, had been rather softened
down, and, wherever it could be attempted, accounted for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is now more than fifty years since the occurrences
which I am about to relate caused a strange sensation
in the gay society of Dublin. The fashionable
world, however, is no recorder of traditions; the
memory of selfishness seldom reaches far; and the
events which occasionally disturb the polite monotony
of its pleasant and heartless progress, however
stamped with the characters of misery and horror,
scarcely outlive the gossip of a season, and (except,
perhaps, in the remembrance of a few more directly
interested in the consequences of the catastrophe) are
in a little time lost to the recollection of all. The
appetite for scandal, or for horror, has been sated;
the incident can yield no more of interest or novelty;
curiosity, frustrated by impenetrable mystery, gives
over the pursuit in despair; the tale has ceased
to be new, grows stale and flat; and so, in a few
years, inquiry subsides into indifference.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Somewhere about the year 1794, the younger
brother of a certain baronet, whom I shall call Sir
James Barton, returned to Dublin. He had served
in the navy with some distinction, having commanded
one of his Majesty&rsquo;s frigates during the
greater part of the American war. Captain Barton
was now apparently some two or three-and-forty
years of age. He was an intelligent and agreeable
companion, when he chose it, though generally reserved,
and occasionally even moody. In society,
however, he deported himself as a man of the world
and a gentleman. He had not contracted any of the
noisy brusqueness sometimes acquired at sea; on the
contrary, his manners were remarkably easy, quiet,
and even polished. He was in person about the
middle size, and somewhat strongly formed; his
countenance was marked with the lines of thought,
and on the whole wore an expression of gravity and
even of melancholy. Being, however, as we have said,
a man of perfect breeding, as well as of affluent circumstances
and good family, he had, of course, ready
access to the best society of the metropolis, without
the necessity of any other credentials. In his personal
habits Captain Barton was economical. He
occupied lodgings in one of the then fashionable
streets in the south side of the town, kept but one
horse and one servant, and though a reputed free-thinker,
he lived an orderly and moral life, indulging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
neither in gaming, drinking, nor any other vicious
pursuit, living very much to himself, without forming
any intimacies, or choosing any companions, and
appearing to mix in gay society rather for the sake
of its bustle and distraction, than for any opportunities
which it offered of interchanging either thoughts
or feelings with its votaries. Barton was therefore
pronounced a saving, prudent, unsocial sort of a
fellow, who bid fair to maintain his celibacy alike
against stratagem and assault, and was likely to live
to a good old age, die rich and leave his money to a
hospital.</p>

<p>It was soon apparent, however, that the nature of
Captain Barton&rsquo;s plans had been totally misconceived.
A young lady, whom we shall call Miss Montague,
was at this time introduced into the fashionable world
of Dublin by her aunt, the Dowager Lady Rochdale.
Miss Montague was decidedly pretty and accomplished,
and having some natural cleverness, and a
great deal of gaiety, became for a while the reigning
toast. Her popularity, however, gained her, for a
time, nothing more than that unsubstantial admiration
which, however pleasant as an incense to vanity,
is by no means necessarily antecedent to matrimony,
for, unhappily for the young lady in question, it was
an understood thing, that, beyond her personal attractions,
she had no kind of earthly provision. Such
being the state of affairs, it will readily be believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
that no little surprise was consequent upon the
appearance of Captain Barton as the avowed lover of
the penniless Miss Montague.</p>

<p>His suit prospered, as might have been expected,
and in a short time it was confidentially communicated
by old Lady Rochdale to each of her hundred
and fifty particular friends in succession, that Captain
Barton had actually tendered proposals of marriage,
with her approbation, to her niece, Miss Montague,
who had, moreover, accepted the offer of his hand,
conditionally upon the consent of her father, who was
then upon his homeward voyage from India, and expected
in two or three months at furthest. About his
consent there could be no doubt. The delay, therefore,
was one merely of form; they were looked upon
as absolutely engaged, and Lady Rochdale, with a
vigour of old-fashioned decorum with which her
niece would, no doubt, gladly have dispensed, withdrew
her thenceforward from all further participation
in the gaieties of the town. Captain Barton was a
constant visitor as well as a frequent guest at the
house, and was permitted all the privileges and intimacy
which a betrothed suitor is usually accorded.
Such was the relation of parties, when the mysterious
circumstances which darken this narrative with inexplicable
melancholy first began to unfold themselves.</p>

<p>Lady Rochdale resided in a handsome mansion at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the north side of Dublin, and Captain Barton&rsquo;s
lodgings, as we have already said, were situated at
the south. The distance intervening was considerable,
and it was Captain Barton&rsquo;s habit generally to
walk home without an attendant, as often as he
passed the evening with the old lady and her fair
charge. His shortest way in such nocturnal walks
lay, for a considerable space, through a line of streets
which had as yet been merely laid out, and little more
than the foundations of the houses constructed. One
night, shortly after his engagement with Miss
Montague had commenced, he happened to remain
unusually late, in company only with her and Lady
Rochdale. The conversation had turned upon the
evidences of revelation, which he had disputed with
the callous scepticism of a confirmed infidel. What
were called &ldquo;French principles&rdquo; had, in those days,
found their way a good deal into fashionable society,
especially that portion of it which professed allegiance
to Whiggism, and neither the old lady nor her charge
was so perfectly free from the taint as to look upon
Captain Barton&rsquo;s views as any serious objection to
the proposed union. The discussion had degenerated
into one upon the supernatural and the marvellous,
in which he had pursued precisely the same line of
argument and ridicule. In all this, it is but true to
state, Captain Barton was guilty of no affectation;
the doctrines upon which he insisted were, in reality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
but too truly the basis of his own fixed belief, if so it
might be called; and perhaps not the least strange of
the many strange circumstances connected with this
narrative, was the fact that the subject of the fearful
influences we are about to describe was himself,
from the deliberate conviction of years, an utter
disbeliever in what are usually termed preternatural
agencies.</p>

<p>It was considerably past midnight when Mr.
Barton took his leave, and set out upon his solitary
walk homeward. He rapidly reached the lonely
road, with its unfinished dwarf walls tracing the
foundations of the projected rows of houses on either
side. The moon was shining mistily, and its imperfect
light made the road he trod but additionally
dreary; that utter silence, which has in it something
indefinably exciting, reigned there, and made the
sound of his steps, which alone broke it, unnaturally
loud and distinct. He had proceeded thus some
way, when on a sudden he heard other footsteps,
pattering at a measured pace, and, as it seemed,
about two score steps behind him. The suspicion of
being dogged is at all times unpleasant; it is, however,
especially so in a spot so desolate and lonely:
and this suspicion became so strong in the mind of
Captain Barton, that he abruptly turned about to
confront his pursuers, but, though there was quite
sufficient moonlight to disclose any object upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
road he had traversed, no form of any kind was
visible.</p>

<p>The steps he had heard could not have been the
reverberation of his own, for he stamped his foot upon
the ground, and walked briskly up and down, in the
vain attempt to wake an echo. Though by no
means a fanciful person, he was at last compelled to
charge the sounds upon his imagination, and treat
them as an illusion. Thus satisfying himself, he
resumed his walk, and before he had proceeded a
dozen paces, the mysterious footfalls were again
audible from behind, and this time, as if with the
special design of showing that the sounds were not
the responses of an echo, the steps sometimes
slackened nearly to a halt, and sometimes hurried
for six or eight strides to a run, and again abated to
a walk.</p>

<p>Captain Barton, as before, turned suddenly round,
and with the same result; no object was visible
above the deserted level of the road. He walked
back over the same ground, determined that, whatever
might have been the cause of the sounds which
had so disconcerted him, it should not escape his
search; the endeavour, however, was unrewarded.
In spite of all his scepticism, he felt something like a
superstitious fear stealing fast upon him, and, with
these unwonted and uncomfortable sensations, he
once more turned and pursued his way. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
no repetition of these haunting sounds, until he had
reached the point where he had last stopped to
retrace his steps. Here they were resumed, and with
sudden starts of running, which threatened to bring
the unseen pursuer close up to the alarmed pedestrian.
Captain Barton arrested his course as formerly; the
unaccountable nature of the occurrence filled him
with vague and almost horrible sensations, and, yielding
to the excitement he felt gaining upon him, he
shouted, sternly, &ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sound of one&rsquo;s own voice, thus exerted, in
utter solitude, and followed by total silence, has in it
something unpleasantly exciting, and he felt a degree
of nervousness which, perhaps, from no cause had he
ever known before. To the very end of this solitary
street the steps pursued him, and it required a strong
effort of stubborn pride on his part to resist the
impulse that prompted him every moment to run for
safety at the top of his speed. It was not until he
had reached his lodging, and sat by his own fireside,
that he felt sufficiently reassured to arrange and
reconsider in his own mind the occurrences which
had so discomposed him: so little a matter, after
all, is sufficient to upset the pride of scepticism,
and vindicate the old simple laws of nature within
us.</p>

<p>Mr. Barton was next morning sitting at a late
breakfast, reflecting upon the incidents of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
previous night, with more of inquisitiveness than
awe&mdash;so speedily do gloomy impressions upon the
fancy disappear under the cheerful influences of day&mdash;when
a letter just delivered by the postman was
placed upon the table before him. There was
nothing remarkable in the address of this missive,
except that it was written in a hand which he did
not know&mdash;perhaps it was disguised&mdash;for the tall
narrow characters were sloped backward; and with
the self-inflicted suspense which we so often see
practised in such cases, he puzzled over the inscription
for a full minute before he broke the seal.
When he did so, he read the following words, written
in the same hand:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquo1">
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Barton, late Captain of the <cite>Dolphin</cite>, is warned
of <em>danger</em>. He will do wisely to avoid &mdash;&mdash; Street&mdash;(here
the locality of his last night&rsquo;s adventure was
named)&mdash;if he walks there as usual, he will meet
with something bad. Let him take warning, once
for all, for he has good reason to dread</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign1">&ldquo;The Watcher.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>
</div>

<p>Captain Barton read and re-read this strange
effusion; in every light and in every direction he
turned it over and over. He examined the paper on
which it was written, and closely scrutinized the
handwriting. Defeated here, he turned to the seal;
it was nothing but a patch of wax, upon which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
accidental impression of a coarse thumb was imperfectly
visible. There was not the slightest mark, no
clue or indication of any kind, to lead him to even
a guess as to its possible origin. The writer&rsquo;s object
seemed a friendly one, and yet he subscribed himself
as one whom he had &ldquo;good reason to dread.&rdquo; Altogether,
the letter, its author, and its real purpose,
were to him an inexplicable puzzle, and one, moreover,
unpleasantly suggestive, in his mind, of associations
connected with the last night&rsquo;s adventure.</p>

<p>In obedience to some feeling&mdash;perhaps of pride&mdash;Mr.
Barton did not communicate, even to his intended
bride, the occurrences which we have just detailed.
Trifling as they might appear, they had in reality
most disagreeably affected his imagination, and he
cared not to disclose, even to the young lady in
question, what she might possibly look upon as
evidences of weakness. The letter might very well
be but a hoax, and the mysterious footfall but a
delusion of his fancy. But although he affected to
treat the whole affair as unworthy of a thought, it
yet haunted him pertinaciously, tormenting him with
perplexing doubts, and depressing him with undefined
apprehensions. Certain it is, that for a considerable
time afterwards he carefully avoided the street
indicated in the letter as the scene of danger.</p>

<p>It was not until about a week after the receipt of
the letter which I have transcribed, that anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
further occurred to remind Captain Barton of its
contents, or to counteract the gradual disappearance
from his mind of the disagreeable impressions which
he had then received. He was returning one night,
after the interval I have stated, from the theatre,
which was then situated in Crow Street, and having
there handed Miss Montague and Lady Rochdale
into their carriage, he loitered for some time with two
or three acquaintances. With these, however, he
parted close to the College, and pursued his way
alone. It was now about one o&rsquo;clock, and the streets
were quite deserted. During the whole of his walk
with the companions from whom he had just parted,
he had been at times painfully aware of the sound of
steps, as it seemed, dogging them on their way.
Once or twice he had looked back, in the uneasy
anticipation that he was again about to experience
the same mysterious annoyances which had so much
disconcerted him a week before, and earnestly hoping
that he might <em>see</em> some form from whom the sounds
might naturally proceed. But the street was deserted;
no form was visible. Proceeding now quite alone
upon his homeward way, he grew really nervous and
uncomfortable, as he became sensible, with increased
distinctness, of the well-known and now absolutely
dreaded sounds.</p>

<p>By the side of the dead wall which bounded the
College Park, the sounds followed, recommencing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
almost simultaneously with his own steps. The same
unequal pace, sometimes slow, sometimes, for a score
yards or so, quickened to a run, was audible from
behind him. Again and again he turned, quickly
and stealthily he glanced over his shoulder almost
at every half-dozen steps; but no one was visible.
The horrors of this intangible and unseen persecution
became gradually all but intolerable; and when at
last he reached his home his nerves were strung to
such a pitch of excitement that he could not rest,
and did not attempt even to lie down until after the
daylight had broken.</p>

<p>He was awakened by a knock at his chamber-door,
and his servant entering, handed him several
letters which had just been received by the early
post. One among them instantly arrested his attention;
a single glance at the direction aroused him
thoroughly. He at once recognized its character,
and read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquo1"><p>&ldquo;You may as well think, Captain Barton, to escape
from your own shadow as from me; do what you
may, I will see you as often as I please, and you
shall see me, for I do not want to hide myself, as you
fancy. Do not let it trouble your rest, Captain
Barton; for, with a <em>good conscience</em>, what need you
fear from the eye of</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign1">&ldquo;The Watcher?&rdquo;</span><br /></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to dwell upon the feelings
elicited by a perusal of this strange communication.
Captain Barton was observed to be unusually absent
and out of spirits for several days afterwards; but no
one divined the cause. Whatever he might think
as to the phantom steps which followed him, there
could be no possible illusion about the letters he
had received; and, to say the least of it, their immediate
sequence upon the mysterious sounds which
had haunted him was an odd coincidence. The
whole circumstance, in his own mind, was vaguely
and instinctively connected with certain passages
in his past life, which, of all others, he hated to
remember.</p>

<p>It so happened that just about this time, in addition
to his approaching nuptials, Captain Barton had
fortunately, perhaps, for himself, some business of an
engrossing kind connected with the adjustment of a
large and long-litigated claim upon certain properties.
The hurry and excitement of business had its natural
effect in gradually dispelling the marked gloom
which had for a time occasionally oppressed him,
and in a little while his spirits had entirely resumed
their accustomed tone.</p>

<p>During all this period, however, he was occasionally
dismayed by indistinct and half-heard repetitions of
the same annoyance, and that in lonely places, in the
day time as well as after nightfall. These renewals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of the strange impressions from which he had suffered
so much were, however, desultory and faint, insomuch
that often he really could not, to his own satisfaction,
distinguish between them and the mere suggestions of
an excited imagination. One evening he walked down
to the House of Commons with a Mr. Norcott, a
Member. As they walked down together he was
observed to become absent and silent, and to a degree
so marked as scarcely to consist with good breeding;
and this, in one who was obviously in all his habits
so perfectly a gentleman, seemed to argue the
pressure of some urgent and absorbing anxiety. It
was afterwards known that, during the whole of that
walk, he had heard the well-known footsteps dogging
him as he proceeded. This, however, was the last
time he suffered from this phase of the persecution
of which he was already the anxious victim. A
new and a very different one was about to be
presented.</p>

<p>Of the new series of impressions which were afterwards
gradually to work out his destiny, that evening
disclosed the first; and but for its relation to the
train of events which followed, the incident would
scarcely have been remembered by any one. As
they were walking in at the passage, a man (of
whom his friend could afterwards remember only
that he was short in stature, looked like a foreigner,
and wore a kind of travelling-cap) walked very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
rapidly, and, as if under some fierce excitement,
directly towards them, muttering to himself fast and
vehemently the while. This odd-looking person
proceeded straight toward Barton, who was foremost,
and halted, regarding him for a moment or two with
a look of menace and fury almost maniacal; and
then turning about as abruptly, he walked before
them at the same agitated pace, and disappeared by
a side passage. Norcott distinctly remembered being
a good deal shocked at the countenance and bearing
of this man, which indeed irresistibly impressed him
with an undefined sense of danger, such as he never
felt before or since from the presence of anything
human; but these sensations were far from amounting
to anything so disconcerting as to flurry or excite
him&mdash;he had seen only a singularly evil countenance,
agitated, as it seemed, with the excitement of madness.
He was absolutely astonished, however, at the
effect of this apparition upon Captain Barton. He
knew him to be a man of proved courage and coolness
in real danger, a circumstance which made his conduct
upon this occasion the more conspicuously odd.
He recoiled a step or two as the stranger advanced,
and clutched his companion&rsquo;s arm in silence, with
a spasm of agony or terror; and then, as the
figure disappeared, shoving him roughly back, he
followed it for a few paces, stopped in great
disorder, and sat down upon a form. A countenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
more ghastly and haggard it was impossible to
fancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Barton, what is the matter?&rdquo;
said Norcott, really alarmed at his friend&rsquo;s appearance.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not hurt, are you? nor unwell?
What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he say? I did not hear it. What
was it?&rdquo; asked Barton, wholly disregarding the
question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut, nonsense!&rdquo; said Norcott, greatly surprised;
&ldquo;who cares what the fellow said? You are
unwell, Barton, decidedly unwell; let me call a
coach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unwell! Yes, no, not exactly unwell,&rdquo; he said,
evidently making an effort to recover his self-possession;
&ldquo;but, to say the truth, I am fatigued, a little
overworked, and perhaps over anxious. You know
I have been in Chancery, and the winding up of a
suit is always a nervous affair. I have felt uncomfortable
all this evening; but I am better now. Come,
come, shall we go on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no. Take my advice, Barton, and go home;
you really do need rest; you are looking absolutely
ill. I really do insist on your allowing me to see
you home,&rdquo; replied his companion.</p>

<p>It was obvious that Barton was not himself disinclined
to be persuaded. He accordingly took his
leave, politely declining his friend&rsquo;s offered escort.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Notwithstanding the few commonplace regrets which
Norcott had expressed, it was plain that he was just
as little deceived as Barton himself by the extempore
plea of illness with which he had accounted for the
strange exhibition, and that he even then suspected
some lurking mystery in the matter.</p>

<p>Norcott called next day at Barton&rsquo;s lodgings, to
inquire for him, and learned from the servant that he
had not left his room since his return the night before;
but that he was not seriously indisposed, and
hoped to be out again in a few days. That evening
he sent for Doctor Richards, then in large and
fashionable practice in Dublin, and their interview
was, it is said, an odd one.</p>

<p>He entered into a detail of his own symptoms in
an abstracted and desultory kind of way, which
seemed to argue a strange want of interest in his own
cure, and, at all events, made it manifest that there
was some topic engaging his mind of more engrossing
importance than his present ailment. He complained
of occasional palpitations, and headache. Doctor
Richards asked him, among other questions, whether
there was any irritating circumstance or anxiety to
account for it. This he denied quickly and peevishly;
and the physician thereupon declared his opinion,
that there was nothing amiss except some slight
derangement of the digestion, for which he accordingly
wrote a prescription, and was about to withdraw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
when Mr. Barton, with the air of a man who
suddenly recollects a topic which had nearly escaped
him, recalled him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, doctor, but I had really almost
forgot; will you permit me to ask you two or three
medical questions?&mdash;rather odd ones, perhaps, but as
a wager depends upon their solution, you will, I
hope, excuse my unreasonableness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The physician readily undertook to satisfy the
inquirer.</p>

<p>Barton seemed to have some difficulty about opening
the proposed interrogatories, for he was silent
for a minute, then walked to his book-case and
returned as he had gone; at last he sat down, and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll think them very childish questions, but I
can&rsquo;t recover my wager without a decision; so I
must put them. I want to know first about lock-jaw.
If a man actually has had that complaint, and appears
to have died of it&mdash;so that in fact a physician of
average skill pronounces him actually dead&mdash;may he,
after all, recover?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doctor Richards smiled, and shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but a blunder may be made,&rdquo; resumed
Barton. &ldquo;Suppose an ignorant pretender to medical
skill; may <em>he</em> be so deceived by any stage of the
complaint, as to mistake what is only a part of the
progress of the disease, for death itself?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No one who had ever seen death,&rdquo; answered he,
&ldquo;could mistake it in the case of lock-jaw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barton mused for a few minutes. &ldquo;I am going to
ask you a question, perhaps still more childish; but
first tell me, are not the regulations of foreign hospitals,
such as those of, let us say, Lisbon, very lax
and bungling? May not all kinds of blunders and
slips occur in their entries of names, and so forth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doctor Richards professed his inability to answer
that query.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, doctor, here is the last of my questions.
You will probably laugh at it; but it must out nevertheless.
Is there any disease, in all the range of
human maladies, which would have the effect of
perceptibly contracting the stature, and the whole
frame&mdash;causing the man to shrink in all his proportions,
and yet to preserve his exact resemblance to
himself in every particular&mdash;with the one exception,
his height and bulk; <em>any</em> disease, mark, no matter
how rare, how little believed in, generally, which
could possibly result in producing such an effect?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The physician replied with a smile, and a very
decided negative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, then,&rdquo; said Barton, abruptly, &ldquo;if a man
be in reasonable fear of assault from a lunatic who is
at large, can he not procure a warrant for his arrest
and detention?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, that is more a lawyer&rsquo;s question than one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
in my way,&rdquo; replied Doctor Richards; &ldquo;but I believe,
on applying to a magistrate, such a course would be
directed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The physician then took his leave; but, just as he
reached the hall-door, remembered that he had left
his cane upstairs, and returned. His reappearance
was awkward, for a piece of paper, which he recognized
as his own prescription, was slowly burning
upon the fire, and Barton sitting close by with an
expression of settled gloom and dismay. Doctor
Richards had too much tact to appear to observe
what presented itself; but he had seen quite enough
to assure him that the mind, and not the body, of
Captain Barton was in reality the seat of his sufferings.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards, the following advertisement
appeared in the Dublin newspapers:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Sylvester Yelland, formerly a foremast man on
board his Majesty&rsquo;s frigate <cite>Dolphin</cite>, or his nearest of
kin, will apply to Mr. Robery Smith, solicitor, at his
office, Dame Street, he or they may hear of something
greatly to his or their advantage. Admission
may be had at any hour up to twelve o&rsquo;clock at night
for the next fortnight, should parties desire to avoid
observation; and the strictest secrecy, as to all communications
intended to be confidential, shall be
honourably observed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <cite>Dolphin</cite>, as we have mentioned, was the vessel
which Captain Barton had commanded; and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
circumstance, connected with the extraordinary
exertions made by the circulation of hand-bills, etc.,
as well as by repeated advertisements, to secure for
this strange notice the utmost possible publicity,
suggested to Doctor Richards the idea that Captain
Barton&rsquo;s extreme uneasiness was somehow connected
with the individual to whom the advertisement was
addressed, and he himself the author of it. This,
however, it is needless to add, was no more than a
conjecture. No information whatsoever, as to the
real purpose of the advertisement itself, was divulged
by the agent, nor yet any hint as to who his employer
might be.</p>

<p>Mr. Barton, although he had latterly begun to earn
for himself the character of a hypochondriac, was yet
very far from deserving it. Though by no means
lively, he had yet, naturally, what are termed &ldquo;even
spirits,&rdquo; and was not subject to continual depressions.
He soon, therefore, began to return to his former
habits; and one of the earliest symptoms of this
healthier tone of spirits was his appearing at a grand
dinner of the Freemasons, of which worthy fraternity
he was himself a brother. Barton, who had been at
first gloomy and abstracted, drank much more freely
than was his wont&mdash;possibly with the purpose of dispelling
his own secret anxieties&mdash;and under the
influence of good wine, and pleasant company, became
gradually (unlike his usual self) talkative, and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
noisy. It was under this unwonted excitement that
he left his company at about half-past ten o&rsquo;clock;
and as conviviality is a strong incentive to gallantry,
it occurred to him to proceed forthwith to
Lady Rochdale&rsquo;s, and pass the remainder of the
evening with her and his destined bride.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he was soon at &mdash;&mdash; Street, and chatting
gaily with the ladies. It is not to be supposed
that Captain Barton had exceeded the limits which
propriety prescribes to good fellowship; he had
merely taken enough of wine to raise his spirits,
without, however, in the least degree unsteadying his
mind, or affecting his manners. With this undue
elevation of spirits had supervened an entire oblivion
or contempt of those undefined apprehensions which
had for so long weighed upon his mind, and to a certain
extent estranged him from society; but as the
night wore away, and his artificial gaiety began to
flag, these painful feelings gradually intruded themselves
again, and he grew abstracted and anxious as
heretofore. He took his leave at length, with an unpleasant
foreboding of some coming mischief, and
with a mind haunted with a thousand mysterious
apprehensions, such as, even while he acutely felt
their pressure, he, nevertheless, inwardly strove, or
affected to contemn.</p>

<p>It was his proud defiance of what he considered to
be his own weakness which prompted him upon this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
occasion to the course which brought about the adventure
which we are now about to relate. Mr. Barton
might have easily called a coach, but he was conscious
that his strong inclination to do so proceeded from
no cause other than what he desperately persisted in
representing to himself to be his own superstitious
tremors. He might also have returned home by a
route different from that against which he had been
warned by his mysterious correspondent; but for the
same reason he dismissed this idea also, and with a
dogged and half desperate resolution to force matters
to a crisis of some kind, to see if there were any reality
in the causes of his former suffering, and if not, satisfactorily
to bring their delusiveness to the proof, he
determined to follow precisely the course which he
had trodden upon the night so painfully memorable
in his own mind as that on which his strange persecution
had commenced. Though, sooth to say, the
pilot who for the first time steers his vessel under the
muzzles of a hostile battery never felt his resolution
more severely tasked than did Captain Barton, as he
breathlessly pursued this solitary path; a path which,
spite of every effort of scepticism and reason, he felt
to be, as respected <em>him</em>, infested by a malignant influence.</p>

<p>He pursued his way steadily and rapidly, scarcely
breathing from intensity of suspense; he, however,
was troubled by no renewal of the dreaded footsteps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and was beginning to feel a return of confidence, as,
more than three-fourths of the way being accomplished
with impunity, he approached the long line
of twinkling oil lamps which indicated the frequented
streets. This feeling of self-congratulation was, however,
but momentary. The report of a musket at
some two hundred yards behind him, and the whistle
of a bullet close to his head, disagreeably and startlingly
dispelled it. His first impulse was to retrace
his steps in pursuit of the assassin; but the road on
either side was, as we have said, embarrassed by the
foundations of a street, beyond which extended waste
fields, full of rubbish and neglected lime and brick
kilns, and all now as utterly silent as though no sound
had ever disturbed their dark and unsightly solitude.
The futility of attempting, single-handed, under such
circumstances, a search for the murderer, was apparent,
especially as no further sound whatever was
audible to direct his pursuit.</p>

<p>With the tumultuous sensations of one whose life
had just been exposed to a murderous attempt, and
whose escape has been the narrowest possible, Captain
Barton turned, and without, however, quickening
his pace actually to a run, hurriedly pursued his way.
He had turned, as we have said, after a pause of a few
seconds, and had just commenced his rapid retreat,
when on a sudden he met the well-remembered little
man in the fur cap. The encounter was but momentary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
The figure was walking at the same exaggerated
pace, and with the same strange air of menace as
before; and <a href="#Frontispiece">as it passed him, he thought he heard
it say, in a furious whisper, &ldquo;Still alive, still alive!&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>The state of Mr. Barton&rsquo;s spirits began now to work
a corresponding alteration in his health and looks,
and to such a degree that it was impossible that the
change should escape general remark. For some
reasons, known but to himself, he took no step whatsoever
to bring the attempt upon his life, which he
had so narrowly escaped, under the notice of the
authorities; on the contrary, he kept it jealously to
himself; and it was not for many weeks after the
occurrence that he mentioned it, and then in strict
confidence to a gentleman, the torments of his mind
at last compelled him to consult a friend.</p>

<p>Spite of his blue devils, however, poor Barton,
having no satisfactory reason to render to the public
for any undue remissness in the attentions which his
relation to Miss Montague required, was obliged to
exert himself, and present to the world a confident
and cheerful bearing. The true source of his sufferings,
and every circumstance connected with them,
he guarded with a reserve so jealous, that it seemed
dictated by at least a suspicion that the origin of his
strange persecution was known to himself, and that
it was of a nature which, upon his own account, he
could not or dare not disclose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>The mind thus turned in upon itself, and constantly
occupied with a haunting anxiety which it
dared not reveal, or confide to any human breast,
became daily more excited; and, of course, more
vividly impressible, by a system of attack which
operated through the nervous system; and in this
state he was destined to sustain, with increasing
frequency, the stealthy visitations of that apparition,
which from the first had seemed to possess so unearthly
and terrible a hold upon his imagination.</p>

<p class="dots">......</p>

<p>It was about this time that Captain Barton called
upon the then celebrated preacher, Doctor Macklin,
with whom he had a slight acquaintance; and an
extraordinary conversation ensued. The divine was
seated in his chambers in college, surrounded with
works upon his favourite pursuit and deep in theology,
when Barton was announced. There was something
at once embarrassed and excited in his manner,
which, along with his wan and haggard countenance,
impressed the student with the unpleasant consciousness
that his visitor must have recently suffered
terribly indeed to account for an alteration so striking,
so shocking.</p>

<p>After the usual interchange of polite greeting, and
a few commonplace remarks, Captain Barton, who
obviously perceived the surprise which his visit had
excited, and which Doctor Macklin was unable wholly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
to conceal, interrupted a brief pause by remarking,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a strange call, Doctor Macklin, perhaps
scarcely warranted by an acquaintance so slight as
mine with you. I should not, under ordinary circumstances,
have ventured to disturb you, but my
visit is neither an idle nor impertinent intrusion. I
am sure you will not so account it, when&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doctor Macklin interrupted him with assurances,
such as good breeding suggested, and Barton resumed,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am come to task your patience by asking your
advice. When I say your patience, I might, indeed,
say more; I might have said your humanity, your
compassion; for I have been, and am a great
sufferer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; replied the churchman, &ldquo;it will,
indeed, afford me infinite gratification if I can
give you comfort in any distress of mind, but&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what you would say,&rdquo; resumed Barton,
quickly. &ldquo;I am an unbeliever, and, therefore, incapable
of deriving help from religion, but don&rsquo;t take
that for granted. At least you must not assume
that, however unsettled my convictions may be, I do
not feel a deep, a very deep, interest in the subject.
Circumstances have lately forced it upon my attention
in such a way as to compel me to review the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
whole question in a more candid and teachable spirit,
I believe, than I ever studied it in before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your difficulties, I take it for granted, refer to
the evidences of revelation,&rdquo; suggested the clergyman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;no&mdash;yes; in fact I am ashamed to
say I have not considered even my objections
sufficiently to state them connectedly; but&mdash;but
there is one subject on which I feel a peculiar
interest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused again, and Doctor Macklin pressed him
to proceed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said Barton, &ldquo;whatever may be my
uncertainty as to the authenticity of what we are
taught to call revelation, of one fact I am deeply
and horribly convinced: that there does exist beyond
this a spiritual world&mdash;a system whose workings are
generally in mercy hidden from us&mdash;a system which
may be, and which is sometimes, partially and
terribly revealed. I am sure, I know,&rdquo; continued
Barton, with increasing excitement, &ldquo;there is a God&mdash;a
dreadful God&mdash;and that retribution follows guilt.
In ways, the most mysterious and stupendous; by
agencies, the most inexplicable and terrific; there is
a spiritual system&mdash;great Heavens, how frightfully I
have been convinced!&mdash;a system malignant, and inexorable,
and omnipotent, under whose persecutions
I am, and have been, suffering the torments of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
damned!&mdash;yes, sir&mdash;yes&mdash;the fires and frenzy of
hell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Barton continued, his agitation became so
vehement that the divine was shocked and even
alarmed. The wild and excited rapidity with which
he spoke, and, above all, the indefinable horror
which stamped his features, afforded a contrast to his
ordinary cool and unimpassioned self-possession,
striking and painful in the last degree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said Doctor Macklin, after a brief
pause, &ldquo;I fear you have been suffering much, indeed;
but I venture to predict that the depression under
which you labour will be found to originate in purely
physical causes, and that with a change of air and
the aid of a few tonics, your spirits will return, and
the tone of your mind be once more cheerful and
tranquil as heretofore. There was, after all, more
truth than we are quite willing to admit in the classic
theories which assigned the undue predominance of
any one affection of the mind to the undue action or
torpidity of one or other of our bodily organs.
Believe me, that a little attention to diet, exercise,
and the other essentials of health, under competent
direction, will make you as much yourself as you
can wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor Macklin,&rdquo; said Barton, with something
like a shudder, &ldquo;I <em>cannot</em> delude myself with such a
hope. I have no hope to cling to but one, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
is, that by some other spiritual agency more potent
than that which tortures me, <em>it</em> may be combated,
and I delivered. If this may not be, I am lost&mdash;now
and for ever lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Barton, you must remember,&rdquo; urged his
companion, &ldquo;that others have suffered as you have
done, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; interrupted he with irritability;
&ldquo;no, sir, I am not a credulous&mdash;far from a superstitious
man. I have been, perhaps, too much the
reverse&mdash;too sceptical, too slow of belief; but unless
I were one whom no amount of evidence could
convince, unless I were to contemn the repeated, the
<em>perpetual</em> evidence of my own senses, I am now&mdash;now
at last constrained to believe I have no escape
from the conviction, the overwhelming certainty,
that I am haunted and dogged, go where I may, by&mdash;by
a Demon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was an almost preternatural energy of
horror in Barton&rsquo;s face, as, with its damp and death-like
lineaments turned towards his companion, he
thus delivered himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God help you, my poor friend!&rdquo; said Doctor
Macklin, much shocked. &ldquo;God help you; for, indeed,
you <em>are</em> a sufferer, however your sufferings may
have been caused.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, God help me,&rdquo; echoed Barton sternly;
&ldquo;but <em>will</em> He help me? will He help me?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray to Him; pray in an humble and trusting
spirit,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray, pray,&rdquo; echoed he again; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t pray; I
could as easily move a mountain by an effort of my
will. I have not belief enough to pray; there is
something within me that will not pray. You prescribe
impossibilities&mdash;literal impossibilities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not find it so, if you will but try,&rdquo; said
Doctor Macklin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try! I <em>have</em> tried, and the attempt only fills
me with confusion and terror. I have tried in vain,
and more than in vain. The awful, unutterable idea
of eternity and infinity oppresses and maddens my
brain, whenever my mind approaches the contemplation
of the Creator; I recoil from the effort, scared,
confounded, terrified. I tell you, Doctor Macklin,
if I am to be saved, it must be by other means. The
idea of the Creator is to me intolerable; my mind
cannot support it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, then, my dear sir,&rdquo; urged he, &ldquo;say how
you would have me serve you. What you would
learn of me. What can I do or say to relieve
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen to me first,&rdquo; replied Captain Barton, with
a subdued air, and an evident effort to suppress his
excitement; &ldquo;listen to me while I detail the circumstances
of the terrible persecution under which my
life has become all but intolerable&mdash;a persecution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
which has made me fear <em>death</em> and the world beyond
the grave as much as I have grown to hate existence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barton then proceeded to relate the circumstances
which we have already detailed, and then continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This has now become habitual&mdash;an accustomed
thing. I do not mean the actual seeing him in the
flesh; thank God, <em>that</em> at least is not permitted daily.
Thank God, from the unutterable horrors of that
visitation I have been mercifully allowed intervals of
repose, though none of security; but from the consciousness
that a malignant spirit is following and
watching me wherever I go, I have never, for a single
instant, a temporary respite: I am pursued with
blasphemies, cries of despair, and appalling hatred; I
hear those dreadful sounds called after me as I turn
the corners of streets; they come in the night-time
while I sit in my chamber alone; they haunt me
everywhere, charging me with hideous crimes, and&mdash;great
God!&mdash;threatening me with coming vengeance
and eternal misery! Hush! do you hear <em>that</em>?&rdquo; he
cried, with a horrible smile of triumph. &ldquo;There&mdash;there,
will that convince you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clergyman felt the chillness of horror irresistibly
steal over him, while, during the wail of a sudden
gust of wind, he heard, or fancied he heard, the
half articulate sounds of rage and derision mingling
in their sough.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of <em>that</em>?&rdquo; at length
Barton cried, drawing a long breath through his teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard the wind,&rdquo; said Doctor Macklin; &ldquo;what
should I think of it? What is there remarkable
about it?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br /><span class="caption">&ldquo;THE PRINCE OF THE POWERS OF THE AIR!&rdquo; MUTTERED BARTON.</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;The prince of the powers of the air,&rdquo; muttered
Barton, with a shudder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut! my dear sir!&rdquo; said the student, with an
effort to reassure himself; for though it was broad
daylight, there was nevertheless something disagreeably
contagious in the nervous excitement under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
which his visitor so obviously suffered. &ldquo;You must
not give way to those wild fancies: you must resist
those impulses of the imagination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay; &lsquo;resist the devil, and he will flee from
thee,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Barton, in the same tone; &ldquo;but <em>how</em>
resist him? Ay, there it is: there is the rub. What&mdash;<em>what</em>
am I to do? What <em>can</em> I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sir, this is fancy,&rdquo; said the man of folios;
&ldquo;you are your own tormentor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, sir; fancy has no part in it,&rdquo; answered
Barton, somewhat sternly. &ldquo;Fancy, forsooth! Was
it that made <em>you</em>, as well as me, hear, but this
moment, those appalling accents of hell? Fancy,
indeed! No, no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you have seen this person frequently,&rdquo; said
the ecclesiastic; &ldquo;why have you not accosted or secured
him? Is it not somewhat precipitate, to say
no more, to assume, as you have done, the existence
of preternatural agency, when, after all, everything
may be easily accountable, if only proper means were
taken to sift the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are circumstances connected with this&mdash;this
<em>appearance</em>,&rdquo; said Barton, &ldquo;which it were needless to
disclose, but which to <em>me</em> are proofs of its horrible
and unearthly nature. I know that the being who
haunts me is not <em>man</em>. I say I <em>know</em> this; I could
prove it to your own conviction.&rdquo; He paused for a
minute, and then added, &ldquo;And as to accosting it, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
dare not&mdash;I could not! When I see it I am powerless;
I stand in the gaze of death, in the triumphant
presence of preterhuman power and malignity; my
strength, and faculties, and memory all forsake me.
Oh, God! I fear, sir, you know not what you speak
of. Mercy, mercy! heaven have pity on me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He leaned his elbow on the table, and passed his
hand across his eyes, as if to exclude some image of
horror, muttering the last words of the sentence he
had just concluded, again and again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Macklin,&rdquo; he said, abruptly raising himself,
and looking full upon the clergyman with an imploring
eye, &ldquo;I know you will do for me whatever
may be done. You know now fully the circumstances
and the nature of the mysterious agency of which I
am the victim. I tell you I cannot help myself; I
cannot hope to escape; I am utterly passive. I
conjure you, then, to weigh my case well, and if
anything may be done for me by vicarious supplication,
by the intercession of the good, or by any aid
or influence whatsoever, I implore of you, I adjure
you in the name of the Most High, give me the
benefit of that influence, deliver me from the body of
this death! Strive for me; pity me! I know you
will; you cannot refuse this; it is the purpose and
object of my visit. Send me away with some hope,
however little&mdash;some faint hope of ultimate deliverance,
and I will nerve myself to endure, from hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to hour, the hideous dream into which my existence
is transformed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doctor Macklin assured him that all he could do
was to pray earnestly for him, and that so much he
would not fail to do. They parted with a hurried and
melancholy valediction. Barton hastened to the carriage
which awaited him at the door, drew the blinds,
and drove away, while Dr. Macklin returned to his
chamber, to ruminate at leisure upon the strange
interview which had just interrupted his studies.</p>

<p>It was not to be expected that Captain Barton&rsquo;s
changed and eccentric habits should long escape
remark and discussion. Various were the theories
suggested to account for it. Some attributed the
alteration to the pressure of secret pecuniary embarrassments;
others to a repugnance to fulfil an engagement
into which he was presumed to have too
precipitately entered; and others, again, to the supposed
incipiency of mental disease, which latter,
indeed, was the most plausible, as well as the most
generally received, of the hypotheses circulated in
the gossip of the day.</p>

<p>From the very commencement of this change, at
first so gradual in its advances, Miss Montague had,
of course, been aware of it. The intimacy involved
in their peculiar relation, as well as the near interest
which it inspired, afforded, in her case, alike opportunity
and motive for the successful exercise of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
keen and penetrating observation peculiar to the sex.
His visits became, at length, so interrupted, and his
manner, while they lasted, so abstracted, strange,
and agitated, that Lady Rochdale, after hinting her
anxiety and her suspicions more than once, at
length distinctly stated her anxiety, and pressed
for an explanation. The explanation was given,
and although its nature at first relieved the worst
solicitudes of the old lady and her niece, yet the
circumstances which attended it, and the really dreadful
consequences which it obviously threatened as
regarded the spirits, and, indeed, the reason, of the
now wretched man who made the strange declaration,
were enough, upon a little reflection, to fill their
minds with perturbation and alarm.</p>

<p>General Montague, the young lady&rsquo;s father, at
length arrived. He had himself slightly known
Barton, some ten or twelve years previously, and
being aware of his fortune and connections, was disposed
to regard him as an unexceptionable and indeed
a most desirable match for his daughter. He laughed
at the story of Barton&rsquo;s supernatural visitations, and
lost not a moment in calling upon his intended son-in-law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Barton,&rdquo; he continued gaily, after a
little conversation, &ldquo;my sister tells me that you are a
victim to blue devils in quite a new and original
shape.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Barton changed countenance, and sighed profoundly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come; I protest this will never do,&rdquo; continued
the General; &ldquo;you are more like a man on
his way to the gallows than to the altar. These
devils have made quite a saint of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barton made an effort to change the conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, it won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said his visitor, laughing;
&ldquo;I am resolved to say out what I have to say about
this magnificent mock mystery of yours. Come,
you must not be angry; but, really, it is too bad to
see you, at your time of life, absolutely frightened
into good behaviour, like a naughty child, by a bugaboo,
and, as far as I can learn, a very particularly
contemptible one. Seriously, though, my dear
Barton, I have been a good deal annoyed at what
they tell me; but, at the same time, thoroughly convinced
that there is nothing in the matter that may
not be cleared up, with just a little attention and
management, within a week at furthest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, General, you do not know&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I do know quite enough to warrant my
confidence,&rdquo; interrupted the soldier. &ldquo;I know that
all your annoyance proceeds from the occasional
appearance of a certain little man in a cap and great-coat,
with a red vest and bad countenance, who
follows you about, and pops upon you at the corners
of lanes, and throws you into ague fits. Now, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
dear fellow, I&rsquo;ll make it my business to <em>catch</em> this
mischievous little mountebank, and either beat him
into a jelly with my own hands, or have him whipped
through the town at the cart&rsquo;s tail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If <em>you</em> knew what I know,&rdquo; said Barton, with
gloomy agitation, &ldquo;you would speak very differently.
Don&rsquo;t imagine that I am so weak and foolish as to
assume, without proof the most overwhelming, the
conclusion to which I have been forced. The proofs
are here, locked up here.&rdquo; As he spoke, he tapped
upon his breast, and with an anxious sigh continued
to walk up and down the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, Barton,&rdquo; said his visitor, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager a
rump and a dozen I collar the ghost, and convince
yourself before many days are over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was running on in the same strain when he was
suddenly arrested, and not a little shocked, by observing
Barton, who had approached the window,
stagger slowly back, like one who had received a
stunning blow&mdash;his arm feebly extended towards the
street, his face and his very lips white as ashes&mdash;while
he uttered, &ldquo;There&mdash;there&mdash;there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>General Montague started mechanically to his
feet, and, from the window of the drawing-room,
saw a figure corresponding, as well as his hurry
would permit him to discern, with the description
of the person whose appearance so constantly and
dreadfully disturbed the repose of his friend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
The figure was just turning from the rails of the
area upon which it had been leaning, and without
waiting to see more, the old gentleman snatched
his cane and hat, and rushed down the stairs
and into the street, in the furious hope of
securing the person, and punishing the audacity of
the mysterious stranger. He looked around him, but
in vain, for any trace of the form he had himself distinctly
beheld. He ran breathlessly to the nearest
corner, expecting to see from thence the retreating
figure, but no such form was visible. Back and forward,
from crossing to crossing, he ran at fault, and
it was not until the curious gaze and laughing countenances
of the passers-by reminded him of the
absurdity of his pursuit, that he checked his hurried
pace, lowered his walking-cane from the menacing
altitude which he had mechanically given it, adjusted
his hat, and walked composedly back again, inwardly
vexed and flurried. He found Barton pale and
trembling in every joint; they both remained silent,
though under emotions very different. At last
Barton whispered, &ldquo;You saw it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It!&mdash;him&mdash;someone&mdash;you mean&mdash;to be sure I
did,&rdquo; replied Montague, testily. &ldquo;But where is the
good or the harm of seeing him? The fellow runs
like a lamplighter. I wanted to <em>catch</em> him, but he
had stolen away before I could reach the hall door.
However, it is no great matter; next time, I dare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
say, I&rsquo;ll do better; and, egad, if I once come within
reach of him, I&rsquo;ll introduce his shoulders to the
weight of my cane, in a way to make him cry
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peccavi</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Notwithstanding General Montague&rsquo;s undertakings
and exhortations, however, Barton continued to
suffer from the self-same unexplained cause. Go
how, when, or where he would, he was still constantly
dogged or confronted by the hateful being who had
established over him so dreadful and mysterious an
influence; nowhere, and at no time, was he secure
against the odious appearance which haunted him
with such diabolical perseverance. His depression,
misery, and excitement became more settled and
alarming every day, and the mental agonies that
ceaselessly preyed upon him began at last so sensibly
to affect his general health, that Lady Rochdale and
General Montague succeeded (without, indeed, much
difficulty) in persuading him to try a short tour on
the Continent, in the hope that an entire change of
scene would, at all events, have the effect of breaking
through the influences of local association, which the
more sceptical of his friends assumed to be by no
means inoperative in suggesting and perpetuating
what they conceived to be a mere form of nervous
illusion. General Montague, moreover, was persuaded
that the figure which haunted his intended son-in-law
was by no means the creation of his own imagination,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
but, on the contrary, a substantial form of flesh
and blood, animated by a spiteful and obstinate resolution,
perhaps with some murderous object in perspective,
to watch and follow the unfortunate gentleman.
Even this hypothesis was not a very pleasant
one; yet it was plain that if Barton could once be
convinced that there was nothing preternatural in
the phenomenon, which he had hitherto regarded in
that light, the affair would lose all its terrors in his
eyes, and wholly cease to exercise upon his health
and spirits the baneful influence which it had hitherto
done. He therefore reasoned, that if the annoyance
were actually escaped from by mere change of scene,
it obviously could not have originated in any supernatural
agency.</p>

<p>Yielding to their persuasions, Barton left Dublin
for England, accompanied by General Montague.
They posted rapidly to London, and thence to Dover,
whence they took the packet with a fair wind for
Calais. The General&rsquo;s confidence in the result of the
expedition on Barton&rsquo;s spirits had risen day by day
since their departure from the shores of Ireland; for,
to the inexpressible relief and delight of the latter, he
had not, since then, so much as even once fancied a
repetition of those impressions which had, when at
home, drawn him gradually down to the very abyss
of horror and despair. This exemption from what
he had begun to regard as the inevitable condition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
his existence, and the sense of security which began to
pervade his mind, were inexpressibly delightful; and
in the exultation of what he considered his deliverance,
he indulged in a thousand happy anticipations
for a future into which so lately he had hardly
dared to look. In short, both he and his companion
secretly congratulated themselves upon the
termination of that persecution which had been to
its immediate victim a source of such unspeakable
agony.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful day, and a crowd of idlers stood
upon the jetty to receive the packet, and enjoy the
bustle of the new arrivals. Montague walked a few
paces in advance of his friend, and as he made his
way through the crowd, a little man touched his arm,
and said to him, in a broad provincial <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patois</i>,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur is walking too fast; he will lose his
sick comrade in the throng, for, by my faith, the poor
gentleman seems to be fainting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Montague turned quickly, and observed that Barton
did indeed look deadly pale. He hastened to his
side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My poor fellow, are you ill?&rdquo; he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>The question was unheeded, and twice repeated,
ere Barton stammered,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw him&mdash;by &mdash;&mdash;, I saw him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Him!</em>&mdash;who?&mdash;where?&mdash;when did you see him?&mdash;where
is he?&rdquo; cried Montague, looking around him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw him&mdash;but he is gone,&rdquo; repeated Barton,
faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where&mdash;where? For God&rsquo;s sake, speak,&rdquo;
urged Montague, vehemently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is but this moment&mdash;<em>here</em>,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what did he look like?&mdash;what had he on?&mdash;what
did he wear?&mdash;quick, quick,&rdquo; urged his excited
companion, ready to dart among the crowd, and collar
the delinquent on the spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He touched your arm&mdash;he spoke to you&mdash;he
pointed to me. God be merciful to me, there is no
escape!&rdquo; said Barton, in the low, subdued tones of
intense despair.</p>

<p>Montague had already bustled away in all the
flurry of mingled hope and indignation; but though
the singular <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">personnel</i> of the stranger who had
accosted him was vividly and perfectly impressed
upon his recollection, he failed to discover among the
crowd even the slightest resemblance to him. After
a fruitless search, in which he enlisted the services of
several of the bystanders, who aided all the more
zealously as they believed he had been robbed, he
at length, out of breath and baffled, gave over the
attempt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my friend, it won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said Barton, with
the faint voice and bewildered, ghastly look of one
who has been stunned by some mortal shock; &ldquo;there
is no use in contending with it; whatever it is, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
dreadful association between me and it is now established;
I shall never escape&mdash;never, never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, nonsense, my dear fellow; don&rsquo;t talk
so,&rdquo; said Montague, with something at once of irritation
and dismay; &ldquo;you must not; never mind, I
say&mdash;never mind, we&rsquo;ll jockey the scoundrel yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was, however, but lost labour to endeavour
henceforward to inspire Barton with one ray of hope;
he became utterly desponding. This intangible and,
as it seemed, utterly inadequate influence was fast
destroying his energies of intellect, character, and
health. His first object was now to return to Ireland,
there, as he believed, and now almost hoped, speedily
to die.</p>

<p>To Ireland, accordingly, he came, and one of the
first faces he saw upon the shore was again that of
his implacable and dreaded persecutor. Barton
seemed at last to have lost not only all enjoyment
and every hope in existence, but all independence of
will besides. He now submitted himself passively
to the management of the friends most nearly interested
in his welfare. With the apathy of entire
despair, he implicitly assented to whatever measures
they suggested and advised; and, as a last resource,
it was determined to remove him to a house of
Lady Rochdale&rsquo;s in the neighbourhood of Clontarf,
where, with the advice of his medical attendant (who
persisted in his opinion that the whole train of impressions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
resulted merely from some nervous derangement)
it was resolved that he was to confine himself
strictly to the house, and to make use only of those
apartments which commanded a view of an enclosed
yard, the gates of which were to be kept jealously
locked. These precautions would at least secure him
against the casual appearance of any living form
which his excited imagination might possibly confound
with the spectre which, as it was contended,
his fancy recognized in every figure that bore even
a distant or general resemblance to the traits with
which he had at first invested it. A month or six
weeks&rsquo; absolute seclusion under these conditions, it
was hoped, might, by interrupting the series of these
terrible impressions, gradually dispel the predisposing
apprehension, and effectually break up the associations
which had confirmed the supposed disease, and
rendered recovery hopeless. Cheerful society and
that of his friends was to be constantly supplied, and
on the whole, very sanguine expectations were indulged
in, that under this treatment the obstinate
hypochondria of the patient might at length give way.</p>

<p>Accompanied, therefore, by Lady Rochdale, General
Montague, and his daughter&mdash;his own affianced
bride&mdash;poor Barton, himself never daring to cherish
a hope of his ultimate emancipation from the strange
horrors under which his life was literally wasting
away, took possession of the apartments whose situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
protected him against the dreadful intrusions
from which he shrank with such unutterable
terror.</p>

<p>After a little time, a steady persistence in this
system began to manifest its results in a very marked
though gradual improvement alike in the health and
spirits of the invalid. Not, indeed, that anything at
all approaching to complete recovery was yet discernible.
On the contrary, to those who had not
seen him since the commencement of his strange
sufferings, such an alteration would have been apparent
as might well have shocked them. The improvement,
however, such as it was, was welcomed
with gratitude and delight, especially by the poor
young lady, whom her attachment to him, as well as
her now singularly painful position, consequent on
his mysterious and protracted illness, rendered an
object of pity scarcely one degree less to be commiserated
than himself.</p>

<p>A week passed&mdash;a fortnight&mdash;a month&mdash;and yet
no recurrence of the hated visitation had agitated
and terrified him as before. The treatment had, so
far, been followed by complete success. The chain
of association had been broken. The constant
pressure upon the overtasked spirits had been removed,
and, under these comparatively favourable
circumstances, the sense of social community with
the world about him, and something of human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
interest, if not of enjoyment, began to reanimate his
mind.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Lady Rochdale, who,
like most old ladies of the day, was deep in family
receipts, and a great pretender to medical science,
being engaged in the concoction of certain unpalatable
mixtures of marvellous virtue, despatched her
own maid to the kitchen garden with a list of herbs
which were there to be carefully culled and brought
back to her for the purpose stated. The hand-maiden,
however, returned with her task scarce half-completed,
and a good deal flurried and alarmed.
Her mode of accounting for her precipitate retreat
and evident agitation was odd, and to the old lady
unpleasantly startling.</p>

<p>It appeared that she had repaired to the kitchen
garden, pursuant to her mistress&rsquo;s directions, and had
there begun to make the specified selection among
the rank and neglected herbs which crowded one
corner of the enclosure, and while engaged in this
pleasant labour she carelessly sang a fragment of an
old song, as she said, &ldquo;to keep herself company.&rdquo;
She was, however, interrupted by a sort of mocking
echo of the air she was singing; and looking up, she
saw through the old thorn hedge, which surrounded
the garden, a singularly ill-looking, little man, whose
countenance wore the stamp of menace and malignity,
standing close to her at the other side of the hawthorn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
screen. She described herself as utterly unable
to move or speak, while he charged her with a message
for Captain Barton, the substance of which she distinctly
remembered to have been to the effect that
he, Captain Barton, must come abroad as usual, and
show himself to his friends out of doors, or else prepare
for a visit in his own chamber. On concluding
this brief message, the stranger had, with a threatening
air, got down into the outer ditch, and seizing
the hawthorn stems in his hands, seemed on the point
of climbing through the fence, a feat which might
have been accomplished without much difficulty.
Without, of course, awaiting this result, the girl,
throwing down her treasures of thyme and rosemary,
had turned and run, with the swiftness of terror, to
the house. Lady Rochdale commanded her, on pain
of instant dismissal, to observe an absolute silence respecting
all that portion of the incident which related
to Captain Barton; and, at the same time, directed
instant search to be made by her men in the garden
and fields adjacent. This measure, however, was
attended with the usual unsuccess, and filled with
fearful and indefinable misgivings, Lady Rochdale
communicated the incident to her brother. The story,
however, until long afterwards, went no further, and
of course it was jealously guarded from Barton,
who continued to mend, though slowly and imperfectly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Barton now began to walk occasionally in the courtyard
which we have mentioned, and which, being
surrounded by a high wall, commanded no view
beyond its own extent. Here he, therefore, considered
himself perfectly secure; and, but for a
careless violation of orders by one of the grooms, he
might have enjoyed, at least for some time longer,
his much-prized immunity. Opening upon the public
road, this yard was entered by a wooden gate, with a
wicket in it, which was further defended by an iron
gate upon the outside. Strict orders had been given
to keep them carefully locked; but, in spite of these,
it had happened that one day, as Barton was slowly
pacing this narrow enclosure, in his accustomed walk,
and reaching the further extremity, was turning to
retrace his steps, he saw the boarded wicket ajar, and
the face of his tormentor immovably looking at him
through the iron bars. For a few seconds he stood
riveted to the earth, breathless and bloodless, in the
fascination of that dreaded gaze, and then fell helplessly
upon the pavement.</p>

<p>There was he found a few minutes afterwards, and
conveyed to his room, the apartment which he was never
afterwards to leave alive. Henceforward, a marked
and unaccountable change was observable in the tone
of his mind. Captain Barton was now no longer the
excited and despairing man he had been before; a
strange alteration had passed upon him, an unearthly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
tranquillity reigned in his mind; it was the anticipated
stillness of the grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Montague, my friend, this struggle is nearly ended
now,&rdquo; he said, tranquilly, but with a look of fixed and
fearful awe. &ldquo;I have, at last, some comfort from that
world of spirits, from which my <em>punishment</em> has come.
I know now that my sufferings will be soon over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Montague pressed him to speak on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, in a softened voice, &ldquo;my punishment
is nearly ended. From sorrow perhaps I
shall never, in time or eternity, escape; but my <em>agony</em>
is almost over. Comfort has been revealed to me,
and what remains of my allotted struggle I will bear
with submission, even with hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear you speak so tranquilly, my
dear fellow,&rdquo; said Montague; &ldquo;peace and cheerfulness
of mind are all you need to make you what you
were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, I never can be that,&rdquo; said he, mournfully.
&ldquo;I am no longer fit for life. I am soon to die: I do
not shrink from death as I did. I am to see <em>him</em> but
once again, and then all is ended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said so, then?&rdquo; suggested Montague.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>He?</em> No, no; good tidings could scarcely come
through him; and these were good and welcome;
and they came so solemnly and sweetly, with unutterable
love and melancholy, such as I could not, without
saying more than is needful or fitting, of other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
long-past scenes and persons, fully explain to you.&rdquo;
As Barton said this he shed tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Montague, mistaking the
source of his emotions, &ldquo;you must not give way.
What is it, after all, but a pack of dreams and nonsense;
or, at worst, the practices of a scheming rascal
that enjoys his power of playing upon your nerves,
and loves to exert it; a sneaking vagabond that owes
you a grudge, and pays it off this way, not daring to
try a more manly one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A grudge, indeed, he owes me; you say rightly,&rdquo;
said Barton, with a sullen shudder; &ldquo;a grudge as you
call it. Oh, God! when the justice of heaven permits
the Evil One to carry out a scheme of vengeance, when
its execution is committed to the lost and frightful
victim of sin, who owes his own ruin to the man, the
very man, whom he is commissioned to pursue; then,
indeed, the torments and terrors of hell are anticipated
on earth. But heaven has dealt mercifully with me:
hope has opened to me at last; and if death could come
without the dreadful sight I am doomed to see, I would
gladly close my eyes this moment upon the world. But
though death is welcome, I shrink with an agony you
cannot understand; a maddening agony, an actual
frenzy of terror, from the last encounter with that&mdash;that
<span class="f8">DEMON</span>, who has drawn me thus to the
verge of the chasm, and who is himself to plunge
me down. I am to see him again, once more, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
under circumstances unutterably more terrific than
ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Barton thus spoke, he trembled so violently that
Montague was really alarmed at the extremity of his
sudden agitation, and hastened to lead him back to
the topic which had before seemed to exert so tranquillizing
an effect upon his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not a dream,&rdquo; he said, after a time; &ldquo;I
was in a different state, I felt differently and
strangely; and yet it was all as real, as clear and vivid,
as what I now see and hear; it was a reality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what <em>did</em> you see and hear?&rdquo; urged his
companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I awakened from the swoon I fell into on
seeing <em>him</em>,&rdquo; said Barton, continuing, as if he had not
heard the question, &ldquo;it was slowly, very slowly; I
was reclining by the margin of a broad lake, surrounded
by misty hills, and a soft, melancholy, rose-coloured
light illuminated it all. It was indescribably
sad and lonely, and yet more beautiful than any
earthly scene. My head was leaning on the lap of a
girl, and she was singing a strange and wondrous
song, that told, I know not how, whether by words
or harmony, of all my life, all that is past, and all
that is still to come. And with the song the old feelings
that I thought had perished within me came
back, and tears flowed from my eyes, partly for the
song and its mysterious beauty, and partly for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
unearthly sweetness of her voice; yet I know the
voice, oh! how well; and I was spell-bound as I
listened and looked at the strange and solitary
scene, without stirring, almost without breathing,
and, alas! alas! without turning my eyes toward the
face that I knew was near me, so sweetly powerful
was the enchantment that held me. And so, slowly
and softly, the song and scene grew fainter, and ever
fainter, to my senses, till all was dark and still
again. And then I wakened to this world, as you
saw, comforted, for I knew that I was forgiven
much.&rdquo; Barton wept again long and bitterly.</p>

<p>From this time, as we have said, the prevailing
tone of his mind was one of profound and tranquil
melancholy. This, however, was not without its interruptions.
He was thoroughly impressed with the
conviction that he was to experience another and a
final visitation, illimitably transcending in horror all
he had before experienced. From this anticipated
and unknown agony he often shrunk in such
paroxysms of abject terror and distraction, as filled
the whole household with dismay and superstitious
panic. Even those among them who affected to discredit
the supposition of preternatural agency in the
matter, were often in their secret souls visited during
the darkness and solitude of night with qualms and
apprehensions which they would not have readily
confessed; and none of them attempted to dissuade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Barton from the resolution on which he now systematically
acted, of shutting himself up in his own apartment.
The window-blinds of this room were kept
jealously down; and his own man was seldom out of
his presence, day or night, his bed being placed in
the same chamber.</p>

<p>This man was an attached and respectable servant;
and his duties, in addition to those ordinarily imposed
upon <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">valets</i>, but which Barton&rsquo;s independent
habits generally dispensed with, were to attend carefully
to the simple precautions by means of which
his master hoped to exclude the dreaded intrusion of
the &ldquo;Watcher,&rdquo; as the strange letter he had at first
received had designated his persecutor. And, in
addition to attending to these arrangements, which
consisted merely in anticipating the possibility of his
master&rsquo;s being, through any unscreened window or
opened door, exposed to the dreaded influence, the
valet was never to suffer him to be for one moment
alone: total solitude, even for a minute, had become
to him now almost as intolerable as the idea of going
abroad into the public ways; it was an instinctive
anticipation of what was coming.</p>

<p>It is needless to say, that, under these mysterious
and horrible circumstances, no steps were taken toward
the fulfilment of that engagement into which he
had entered. There was quite disparity enough in
point of years, and indeed of habits, between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
young lady and Captain Barton, to have precluded
anything like very vehement or romantic attachment
on her part. Though grieved and anxious, therefore,
she was very far from being heart-broken; a
circumstance which, for the sentimental purposes of
our tale, is much to be deplored. But truth must be
told, especially in a narrative whose chief, if not
only, pretensions to interest consist in a rigid
adherence to facts, or what are so reported to have
been.</p>

<p>Miss Montague, nevertheless, devoted much of her
time to a patient but fruitless attempt to cheer the
unhappy invalid. She read for him, and conversed
with him; but it was apparent that whatever exertions
he made, the endeavour to escape from the one
constant and ever-present fear that preyed upon him
was utterly and miserably unavailing.</p>

<p>Young ladies, as all the world knows, are much
given to the cultivation of pets; and among those
who shared the favour of Miss Montague was a fine
old owl, which the gardener, who caught him napping
among the ivy of a ruined stable, had dutifully
presented to that young lady.</p>

<p>The caprice which regulates such preferences was
manifested in the extravagant favour with which this
grim and ill-favoured bird was at once distinguished
by his mistress; and, trifling as this whimsical
circumstance may seem, I am forced to mention it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
inasmuch as it is connected, oddly enough, with the
concluding scene of the story. Barton, so far from
sharing in this liking for the new favourite, regarded
it from the first with an antipathy as violent as it
was utterly unaccountable. Its very vicinity was insupportable
to him. He seemed to hate and dread
it with a vehemence absolutely laughable, and to
those who have never witnessed the exhibition of
antipathies of this kind, his dread would seem all but
incredible.</p>

<p>With these few words of preliminary explanation,
I shall proceed to state the particulars of the last
scene in this strange series of incidents. It was
almost two o&rsquo;clock one winter&rsquo;s night, and Barton
was, as usual at that hour, in his bed; the servant
we have mentioned occupied a smaller bed in the
same room, and a candle was burning. The man
was on a sudden aroused by his master, who said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get it out of my head that that accursed
bird has escaped somehow, and is lurking in some
corner of the room. I have been dreaming of him.
Get up, Smith, and look about; search for him.
Such hateful dreams!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servant rose, and examined the chamber, and
while engaged in so doing, he heard the well-known
sound, more like a long-drawn gasp than a hiss, with
which these birds from their secret haunts affright
the quiet of the night. This ghostly indication of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
proximity, for the sound proceeded from the passage
upon which Barton&rsquo;s chamber-door opened, determined
the search of the servant, who, opening the
door, proceeded a step or two forward for the purpose
of driving the bird away. He had, however, hardly
entered the lobby, when the door behind him slowly
swung to under the impulse, as it seemed, of some
gentle current of air; but as immediately over the
door there was a kind of window, intended in the
daytime to aid in lighting the passage, and through
which the rays of the candle were then issuing, the
valet could see quite enough for his purpose. As he
advanced he heard his master (who, lying in a well-curtained
bed had not, as it seemed, perceived his
exit from the room) call him by name, and direct him
to place the candle on the table by his bed. The
servant, who was now some way in the long passage,
did not like to raise his voice for the purpose of replying,
lest he should startle the sleeping inmates of the
house, began to walk hurriedly and softly back again,
when, to his amazement, he heard a voice in the
interior of the chamber answering calmly, and the man
actually saw, through the window which over-topped
the door, that the light was slowly shifting, as if
carried across the chamber in answer to his master&rsquo;s
call. Palsied by a feeling akin to terror, yet not unmingled
with a horrible curiosity, he stood breathless
and listening at the threshold, unable to summon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
resolution to push open the door and enter. Then
came a rustling of the curtains, and a sound like that
of one who in a low voice hushes a child to rest, in
the midst of which he heard Barton say, in a tone
of stifled horror&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, God&mdash;oh, my God!&rdquo; and
repeat the same exclamation several times. Then
ensued a silence, which again was broken by the
same strange soothing sound; and at last there burst
forth, in one swelling peal, a yell of agony so appalling
and hideous, that, under some impulse of ungovernable
horror, the man rushed to the door, and
with his whole strength strove to force it open.
Whether it was that, in his agitation, he had himself
but imperfectly turned the handle, or that the door was
really secured upon the inside, he failed to effect an
entrance; and as he tugged and pushed, yell after
yell rang louder and wilder through the chamber,
accompanied all the while by the same hushing
sounds. Actually freezing with terror, and scarce
knowing what he did, the man turned and ran down
the passage, wringing his hands in the extremity of
horror and irresolution. At the stair-head he was encountered
by General Montague, scared and eager,
and just as they met the fearful sounds had ceased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&mdash;who&mdash;where is your master?&rdquo; said
Montague, with the incoherence of extreme agitation.
&ldquo;Has anything&mdash;for God&rsquo;s sake, is anything
wrong?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord have mercy on us, it&rsquo;s all over,&rdquo; said the
man, staring wildly towards his master&rsquo;s chamber.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead, sir; I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without waiting for inquiry or explanation, Montague,
closely followed by the servant, hurried to the
chamber-door, turned the handle, and pushed it open.
As the door yielded to his pressure, the ill-omened
bird of which the servant had been in search, uttering
its spectral warning, started suddenly from the far
side of the bed, and flying through the doorway close
over their heads, and extinguishing, in its passage,
the candle which Montague carried, crashed through
the skylight that overlooked the lobby, and sailed
away into the darkness of the outer space.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There it is, God bless us!&rdquo; whispered the man,
after a breathless pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Curse that bird!&rdquo; muttered the general, startled
by the suddenness of the apparition, and unable to
conceal his discomposure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The candle was moved,&rdquo; said the man, after
another breathless pause; &ldquo;see, they put it by the
bed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Draw the curtains, fellow, and don&rsquo;t stand gaping
there,&rdquo; whispered Montague, sternly.</p>

<p>The man hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold this, then,&rdquo; said Montague, impatiently,
thrusting the candlestick into the servant&rsquo;s hand; and
himself advancing to the bedside, he drew the curtains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
apart. The light of the candle, which was still
burning at the bedside, fell upon a figure huddled
together, and half upright, at the head of the bed.
It seemed as though it had shrunk back as far as the
solid panelling would allow, and the hands were still
clutched in the bed-clothes.</p>

<div class="figcenter1">

<br /><span class="caption">EXTINGUISHING IN ITS PASSAGE THE CANDLE WHICH MONTAGUE
CARRIED.</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Barton, Barton, Barton!&rdquo; cried the general, with
a strange mixture of awe and vehemence.</p>

<p>He took the candle, and held it so that it shone full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
upon his face. The features were fixed, stern and
white; the jaw was fallen, and the sightless eyes,
still open, gazed vacantly forward toward the front
of the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God Almighty, he&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo; muttered the general,
as he looked upon this fearful spectacle. They both
continued to gaze upon it in silence for a minute or
more. &ldquo;And cold, too,&rdquo; said Montague, withdrawing
his hand from that of the dead man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And see, see; may I never have life, sir,&rdquo; added
the man, after another pause, with a shudder, &ldquo;but
there was something else on the bed with him!
Look there&mdash;look there; see that, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the man thus spoke, he pointed to a deep indenture,
as if caused by a heavy pressure, near the
foot of the bed.</p>

<p>Montague was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, sir, come away, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; whispered
the man, drawing close up to him, and holding fast
by his arm, while he glanced fearfully round; &ldquo;what
good can be done here now?&mdash;come away, for God&rsquo;s
sake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment they heard the steps of more than
one approaching, and Montague, hastily desiring the
servant to arrest their progress, endeavoured to loose
the rigid grip with which the fingers of the dead man
were clutched in the bed-clothes, and drew, as well as
he was able, the awful figure into a reclining posture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Then closing the curtains carefully upon it, he hastened
himself to meet those who were approaching.</p>

<p class="dots">.....</p>

<p>It is needless to follow the personages so slightly
connected with this narrative into the events of their
after lives; it is enough for us to remark that no clue
to the solution of these mysterious occurrences was
ever afterwards discovered; and so long an interval
having now passed, it is scarcely to be expected that
time can throw any new light upon their inexplicable
obscurity. Until the secrets of the earth shall be
no longer hidden these transactions must remain
shrouded in mystery.</p>

<p>The only occurrence in Captain Barton&rsquo;s former
life to which reference was ever made, as having any
possible connection with the sufferings with which his
existence closed, and which he himself seemed to regard
as working out a retribution for some grievous sin
of his past life, was a circumstance which not for
several years after his death was brought to light.
The nature of this disclosure was painful to his relatives
and discreditable to his memory.</p>

<p>It appeared, then, that some eight years before
Captain Barton&rsquo;s final return to Dublin, he had
formed, in the town of Plymouth, a guilty attachment,
the object of which was the daughter of one of
the ship&rsquo;s crew under his command. The father had
visited the frailty of his unhappy child with extreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
harshness, and even brutality, and it was said that she
had died heart-broken. Presuming upon Barton&rsquo;s
implication in her guilt, this man had conducted himself
towards him with marked insolence, and Barton
resented this&mdash;and what he resented with still more
exasperated bitterness, his treatment of the unfortunate
girl&mdash;by a systematic exercise of those terrible
and arbitrary severities with which the regulations of the
navy arm those who are responsible for its discipline.
The man had at length made his escape, while the
vessel was in port at Lisbon, but died, as it was said,
in an hospital in that town, of the wounds inflicted in
one of his recent and sanguinary punishments.</p>

<p>Whether these circumstances in reality bear or not
upon the occurrences of Barton&rsquo;s after-life, it is of
course impossible to say. It seems, however, more
than probable that they were, at least in his own
mind, closely associated with them. But however
the truth may be as to the origin and motives of this
mysterious persecution, there can be no doubt that,
with respect to the agencies by which it was accomplished,
absolute and impenetrable mystery is like to
prevail until the day of doom.</p>

</div>


<p>The following paper is written in a female hand, and
was no doubt communicated to my much regretted
friend by the lady whose early history it serves to
illustrate, the Countess D&mdash;&mdash;. She is no more&mdash;she
long since died, a childless and a widowed wife, and,
as her letter sadly predicts, none survive to whom the
publication of this narrative can prove &ldquo;injurious, or
even painful.&rdquo; Strange! two powerful and wealthy
families, that in which she was born, and that into
which she had married, are utterly extinct.</p>

<p>To those who know anything of the history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Irish families, as they were less than a century ago,
the facts which immediately follow will at once suggest
the names of the principal actors; and to others
their publication would be useless&mdash;to us, possibly, if
not probably injurious. I have therefore altered
such of the names as might, if stated, get us into
difficulty; others, belonging to minor characters in the
strange story, I have left untouched.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;You have asked me to furnish
you with a detail of the strange events which marked
my early history, and I have, without hesitation,
applied myself to the task, knowing that, while I live,
a kind consideration for my feelings will prevent you
giving publicity to the statement; and conscious
that, when I am no more, there will not survive one
to whom the narrative can prove injurious, or even
painful.</p>

<p>My mother died when I was quite an infant, and
of her I have no recollection, even the faintest. By
her death, my education and habits were left solely
to the guidance of my surviving parent; and, so far as
a stern attention to my religious instruction, and an
active anxiety evinced by his procuring for me the
best masters to perfect me in those accomplishments
which my station and wealth might seem to require,
could avail, he amply discharged the task.</p>

<p>My father was what is called an oddity, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
treatment of me, though uniformly kind, flowed less
from affection and tenderness than from a sense of
obligation and duty. Indeed, I seldom even spoke
to him except at meal-times, and then his manner
was silent and abrupt; his leisure hours, which were
many, were passed either in his study or in solitary
walks; in short, he seemed to take no further interest
in my happiness or improvement than a conscientious
regard to the discharge of his own duty would seem
to claim.</p>

<p>Shortly before my birth, a circumstance had occurred
which had contributed much to form and to confirm
my father&rsquo;s secluded habits&mdash;it was the fact that a
suspicion of murder had fallen upon his younger
brother, a suspicion not sufficiently definite to lead to
an indictment, yet strong enough to ruin him in
public opinion.</p>

<p>This disgraceful and dreadful doubt cast upon the
family name my father felt deeply and bitterly, and
not the less so that he himself was thoroughly convinced
of his brother&rsquo;s innocence. The sincerity and
strength of this impression he shortly afterwards
proved in a manner which produced the dark events
which follow. Before, however, I enter upon the statement
of them, I ought to relate the circumstances which
had awakened the suspicion; inasmuch as they are in
themselves somewhat curious, and, in their effects,
most intimately connected with my after history.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>My uncle, Sir Arthur T&mdash;&mdash;n, was a gay and extravagant
man, and, among other vices, was ruinously
addicted to gaming; this unfortunate propensity,
even after his fortune had suffered so severely as
to render inevitable a reduction in his expenses by
no means inconsiderable, nevertheless continued to
actuate him, almost to the exclusion of all other
pursuits. He was a proud, or rather a vain man,
and could not bear to make the diminution of
his income a matter of gratulation and triumph to
those with whom he had hitherto competed; and the
consequence was that he frequented no longer the
expensive haunts of dissipation, and retired from the
gay world, leaving his coterie to discover his reasons
as best they might.</p>

<p>He did not, however, forego his favourite vice, for,
though he could not worship his divinity in the
costly temples where it was formerly his wont to take
his stand, yet he found it very possible to bring about
him a sufficient number of the votaries of chance to
answer all his ends. The consequence was that
Carrickleigh, which was the name of my uncle&rsquo;s
residence, was never without one or more of such
reckless visitors.</p>

<p>It happened that upon one occasion he was visited
by one Hugh Tisdall&mdash;a gentleman of loose habits
but of considerable wealth&mdash;who had, in early
youth, travelled with my uncle upon the Continent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
The period of his visit was winter, and, consequently,
the house was nearly deserted except by its regular
inmates; Mr. Tisdall was therefore highly acceptable,
particularly as my uncle was aware that his visitor&rsquo;s
tastes accorded exactly with his own.</p>

<p>Both parties seemed determined to avail themselves
of their suitability during the brief stay which Mr.
Tisdall had promised; the consequence was that they
shut themselves up in Sir Arthur&rsquo;s private room for
nearly all the day and the greater part of the night,
during the space of nearly a week. At the end of
this period the servant having one morning, as usual,
knocked at Mr. Tisdall&rsquo;s bedroom door repeatedly,
received no answer, and, upon attempting to enter,
found that it was locked. This appeared suspicious,
and the inmates of the house having been alarmed,
the door was forced open, and, on proceeding to the
bed, they found the body of its occupant perfectly
lifeless, and hanging half-way out, the head downwards,
and near the floor. One deep wound had
been inflicted upon the temple, apparently with some
blunt instrument, which had penetrated the brain;
and another blow less effective, probably the first
aimed, had grazed the head, removing some of the
scalp, but leaving the skull untouched. The door
had been double-locked upon the inside, in evidence
of which the key still lay where it had been placed in
the lock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>The window, though not secured on the interior,
was closed&mdash;a circumstance not a little puzzling, as
it afforded the only other mode of escape from the
room; it looked out, too, upon a kind of courtyard,
round which the old buildings stood, formerly accessible
by a narrow doorway and passage lying in the
oldest side of the quadrangle, but which had since
been built up, so as to preclude all ingress or egress.
The room was also upon the second story, and the
height of the window considerable. Near the bed
were found a pair of razors belonging to the murdered
man, one of them upon the ground and both of them
open. The weapon which had inflicted the mortal
wound was not to be found in the room, nor were
any footsteps or other traces of the murderer discoverable.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of Sir Arthur himself, a coroner
was instantly summoned to attend, and an inquest
was held; nothing, however, in any degree conclusive
was elicited. The walls, ceiling, and floor
of the room were carefully examined, in order to
ascertain whether they contained a trap-door or other
concealed mode of entrance&mdash;but no such thing
appeared.</p>

<p>Such was the minuteness of investigation employed
that although the grate had contained a large fire during
the night, they proceeded to examine even the very
chimney, in order to discover whether escape by it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
were possible; but this attempt, too, was fruitless, for
the chimney, built in the old fashion, rose in a perfectly
perpendicular line from the hearth to a height
of nearly fourteen feet above the roof, affording in its
interior scarcely the possibility of ascent, the flue
being smoothly plastered, and sloping towards the top
like an inverted funnel. Even if the summit of the
chimney were attained, it promised, owing to its great
height, but a precarious descent upon the sharp and
steep-ridged roof. The ashes, too, which lay in the
grate, and the soot, as far as it could be seen, were
undisturbed, a circumstance almost conclusive.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur was of course examined; his evidence
was given with a clearness and unreserve which seemed
calculated to silence all suspicion. He stated that
up to the day and night immediately preceding the
catastrophe, he had lost to a heavy amount, but that,
at their last sitting, he had not only won back his
original loss, but upwards of four thousand pounds
in addition; in evidence of which he produced an
acknowledgment of debt to that amount in the handwriting
of the deceased, and bearing the date of the
fatal night. He had mentioned the circumstance to
his lady, and in presence of some of the domestics;
which statement was supported by their respective
evidence.</p>

<p>One of the jury shrewdly observed that the circumstance
of Mr. Tisdall&rsquo;s having sustained so heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
a loss might have suggested to some ill-minded
persons, accidentally hearing it, the plan of robbing
him, after having murdered him, in such a manner as
might make it appear that he had committed suicide;
a supposition which was strongly supported by the
razors having been found thus displaced, and removed
from their case. Two persons had probably been
engaged in the attempt, one watching by the sleeping
man, and ready to strike him in case of his awakening
suddenly, while the other was procuring the razors
and employed in inflicting the fatal gash, so as to
make it appear to have been the act of the murdered
man himself. It was said that while the juror
was making this suggestion Sir Arthur changed
colour.</p>

<p>Nothing, however, like legal evidence appeared
against him, and the consequence was that the verdict
was found against a person or persons unknown; and
for some time the matter was suffered to rest, until,
after about five months, my father received a letter
from a person signing himself Andrew Collis, and
representing himself to be the cousin of the deceased.
This letter stated that Sir Arthur was likely to incur
not merely suspicion, but personal risk, unless he
could account for certain circumstances connected
with the recent murder, and contained a copy of a
letter written by the deceased, and bearing date&mdash;the
day of the week, and of the month&mdash;upon the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the deed of blood had been perpetrated. Tisdall&rsquo;s
note ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Collis</span>,&mdash;I have had sharp work with Sir
Arthur; he tried some of his stale tricks, but soon
found that <em>I</em> was Yorkshire too; it would not do&mdash;you
understand me. We went to the work like good
ones, head, heart and soul; and, in fact, since I came
here, I have lost no time. I am rather fagged, but I
am sure to be well paid for my hardship; I never
want sleep so long as I can have the music of a dice-box,
and wherewithal to pay the piper. As I told
you, he tried some of his queer turns, but I foiled
him like a man, and, in return, gave him more than
he could relish of the genuine <em>dead knowledge</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In short, I have plucked the old baronet as never
baronet was plucked before; I have scarce left him
the stump of a quill; I have got promissory notes in
his hand to the amount of&mdash;if you like round numbers,
say, thirty thousand pounds, safely deposited in my
portable strong-box, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alias</i> double-clasped pocket-book.
I leave this ruinous old rat-hole early on
to-morrow, for two reasons&mdash;first, I do not want to
play with Sir Arthur deeper than I think his security,
that is, his money, or his money&rsquo;s worth, would
warrant; and, secondly, because I am safer a hundred
miles from Sir Arthur than in the house with him.
Look you, my worthy, I tell you this between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
ourselves&mdash;I may be wrong, but, by G&mdash;&mdash;, I am as
sure as that I am now living, that Sir A&mdash;&mdash; attempted
to poison me last night. So much for old friendship
on both sides!</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I won the last stake, a heavy one enough,
my friend leant his forehead upon his hands, and
you&rsquo;ll laugh when I tell you that his head literally
smoked like a hot dumpling. I do not know whether
his agitation was produced by the plan which he had
against me, or by his having lost so heavily&mdash;though
it must be allowed that he had reason to be a little
funked, whichever way his thoughts went; but he
pulled the bell, and ordered two bottles of champagne.
While the fellow was bringing them he
drew out a promissory note to the full amount,
which he signed, and, as the man came in with the
bottles and glasses, he desired him to be off; he
filled out a glass for me, and, while he thought my
eyes were off, for I was putting up his note at the
time, he dropped something slyly into it, no doubt
to sweeten it; but I saw it all, and when he handed
it to me, I said, with an emphasis which he might or
might not understand:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There is some sediment in this; I&rsquo;ll not
drink it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is there?&rsquo; said he, and at the same time
snatched it from my hand and threw it into the fire.
What do you think of that? have I not a tender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
chicken to manage? Win or lose, I will not play
beyond five thousand to-night, and to-morrow sees
me safe out of the reach of Sir Arthur&rsquo;s champagne.
So, all things considered, I think you must allow
that you are not the last who have found a knowing
boy in</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign4">&ldquo;Yours to command,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;Hugh Tisdall.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of the authenticity of this document I never heard
my father express a doubt; and I am satisfied that,
owing to his strong conviction in favour of his
brother, he would not have admitted it without
sufficient inquiry, inasmuch as it tended to confirm
the suspicions which already existed to his prejudice.</p>

<p>Now, the only point in this letter which made
strongly against my uncle was the mention of the
&ldquo;double-clasped pocket-book&rdquo; as the receptacle of
the papers likely to involve him, for this pocket-book
was not forthcoming, nor anywhere to be found, nor
had any papers referring to his gaming transactions
been found upon the dead man. However, whatever
might have been the original intention of this
Collis, neither my uncle nor my father ever heard
more of him; but he published the letter in Faulkner&rsquo;s
Newspaper, which was shortly afterwards made the
vehicle of a much more mysterious attack. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
passage in that periodical to which I allude appeared
about four years afterwards, and while the fatal
occurrence was still fresh in public recollection. It
commenced by a rambling preface, stating that &ldquo;a
<em>certain person</em> whom <em>certain</em> persons thought to be
dead, was not so, but living, and in full possession of
his memory, and moreover ready and able to make
<em>great</em> delinquents tremble.&rdquo; It then went on to
describe the murder, without, however, mentioning
names; and in doing so, it entered into minute and
circumstantial particulars of which none but an <em>eye-witness</em>
could have been possessed, and by implications
almost too unequivocal to be regarded in the
light of insinuation, to involve the &ldquo;<em>titled gambler</em>&rdquo;
in the guilt of the transaction.</p>

<p>My father at once urged Sir Arthur to proceed
against the paper in an action of libel; but he would
not hear of it, nor consent to my father&rsquo;s taking any
legal steps whatever in the matter. My father, however,
wrote in a threatening tone to Faulkner, demanding
a surrender of the author of the obnoxious
article. The answer to this application is still in my
possession, and is penned in an apologetic tone: it
states that the manuscript had been handed in, paid
for, and inserted as an advertisement, without sufficient
inquiry, or any knowledge as to whom it
referred.</p>

<p>No step, however, was taken to clear my uncle&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
character in the judgment of the public; and as he
immediately sold a small property, the application of
the proceeds of which was known to none, he was
said to have disposed of it to enable himself to buy
off the threatened information. However the truth
might have been, it is certain that no charges
respecting the mysterious murder were afterwards
publicly made against my uncle, and, as far as
external disturbances were concerned, he enjoyed
henceforward perfect security and quiet.</p>

<p>A deep and lasting impression, however, had been
made upon the public mind, and Sir Arthur T&mdash;&mdash;n
was no longer visited or noticed by the gentry and
aristocracy of the county, whose attention and courtesies
he had hitherto received. He accordingly
affected to despise these enjoyments which he could
not procure, and shunned even that society which he
might have commanded.</p>

<p>This is all that I need recapitulate of my uncle&rsquo;s
history, and I now recur to my own. Although my
father had never, within my recollection, visited, or
been visited by, my uncle, each being of sedentary,
procrastinating, and secluded habits, and their respective
residences being very far apart&mdash;the one
lying in the county of Galway, the other in that of
Cork&mdash;he was strongly attached to his brother, and
evinced his affection by an active correspondence,
and by deeply and proudly resenting that neglect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
which had marked Sir Arthur as unfit to mix in
society.</p>

<p>When I was about eighteen years of age, my
father, whose health had been gradually declining,
died, leaving me in heart wretched and desolate, and,
owing to his previous seclusion, with few acquaintances,
and almost no friends.</p>

<p>The provisions of his will were curious, and when
I had sufficiently come to myself to listen to or
comprehend them, surprised me not a little: all his
vast property was left to me, and to the heirs of my
body, for ever; and, in default of such heirs, it was
to go after my death to my uncle, Sir Arthur, without
any entail.</p>

<p>At the same time, the will appointed him my
guardian, desiring that I might be received within
his house, and reside with his family, and under his
care, during the term of my minority; and in consideration
of the increased expense consequent upon
such an arrangement, a handsome annuity was
allotted to him during the term of my proposed
residence.</p>

<p>The object of this last provision I at once understood:
my father desired, by making it the direct,
apparent interest of Sir Arthur that I should die
without issue, while at the same time placing me
wholly in his power, to prove to the world how
great and unshaken was his confidence in his brother&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
innocence and honour, and also to afford him an
opportunity of showing that this mark of confidence
was not unworthily bestowed.</p>

<p>It was a strange, perhaps an idle scheme; but as
I had been always brought up in the habit of considering
my uncle as a deeply-injured man, and had
been taught, almost as a part of my religion, to regard
him as the very soul of honour, I felt no further uneasiness
respecting the arrangement than that likely to
result to a timid girl of secluded habits from the
immediate prospect of taking up her abode for the
first time in her life among total strangers. Previous
to leaving my home, which I felt I should do with a
heavy heart, I received a most tender and affectionate
letter from my uncle, calculated, if anything could
do so, to remove the bitterness of parting from scenes
familiar and dear from my earliest childhood, and in
some degree to reconcile me to the change.</p>

<p>It was during a fine autumn that I approached
the old domain of Carrickleigh. I shall not soon
forget the impression of sadness and of gloom which
all that I saw produced upon my mind; the sunbeams
were falling with a rich and melancholy tint
upon the fine old trees, which stood in lordly groups,
casting their long, sweeping shadows over rock and
sward. There was an air of desolation and decay about
the spot, which amounted almost to desolation; the
symptoms of this increased in number as we approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the building itself, near which the ground
had been originally more artificially and carefully
cultivated than elsewhere, and the neglect consequently
more immediately and strikingly betrayed
itself.</p>

<p>As we proceeded, the road wound near the
beds of what had been formerly two fish-ponds&mdash;now
nothing more than stagnant swamps, overgrown
with rank weeds, and here and there encroached
upon by the straggling underwood. The
avenue itself was much broken, and in many places
the stones were almost concealed by grass and
nettles; the loose stone walls which had here and
there intersected the broad park were, in many places,
broken down, so as no longer to answer their original
purpose as fences; piers were now and then to be
seen, but the gates were gone. And, to add to the
general air of dilapidation, some huge trunks were
lying scattered through the venerable old trees,
either the work of the winter storms, or perhaps the
victims of some extensive but desultory scheme of
denudation, which the projector had not capital or
perseverance to carry into full effect.</p>

<p>After the carriage had travelled a mile of this
avenue, we reached the summit of rather an abrupt
eminence, one of the many which added to the
picturesqueness, if not to the convenience of this
rude passage. From the top of this ridge the grey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
walls of Carrickleigh were visible, rising at a small
distance in front, and darkened by the hoary wood
which crowded around them. It was a quadrangular
building of considerable extent, and the front which
lay towards us, and in which the great entrance was
placed, bore unequivocal marks of antiquity; the
time-worn, solemn aspect of the old building, the
ruinous and deserted appearance of the whole place,
and the associations which connected it with a dark
page in the history of my family, combined to depress
spirits already predisposed for the reception of
sombre and dejecting impressions.</p>

<p>When the carriage drew up in the grass-grown
courtyard before the hall door, two lazy-looking
men, whose appearance well accorded with that of
the place which they tenanted, alarmed by the obstreperous
barking of a great chained dog, ran out
from some half-ruinous out-houses, and took charge
of the horses; the hall door stood open, and I entered
a gloomy and imperfectly lighted apartment, and
found no one within. However, I had not long to
wait in this awkward predicament, for before my
luggage had been deposited in the house&mdash;indeed,
before I had well removed my cloak and other wraps,
so as to enable me to look around&mdash;a young girl ran
lightly into the hall, and kissing me heartily, and
somewhat boisterously, exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear cousin, my dear Margaret, I am so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
delighted, so out of breath. We did not expect you
till ten o&rsquo;clock; my father is somewhere about the
place; he must be close at hand. James, Corney&mdash;run
out and tell your master&mdash;my brother is seldom
at home, at least at any reasonable hour&mdash;you must
be so tired, so fatigued, let me show you to your room.
See that Lady Margaret&rsquo;s luggage is all brought up,
you must lie down and rest yourself. Deborah, bring
some coffee&mdash; Up these stairs! We are so delighted
to see you, you cannot think how lonely I have been.
How steep these stairs are, are they not? I am so
glad you are come; I could hardly bring myself to
believe that you were really coming; how good of
you, dear Lady Margaret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was real good nature and delight in my
cousin&rsquo;s greeting, and a kind of constitutional confidence
of manner which placed me at once at ease,
and made me feel immediately upon terms of intimacy
with her. The room into which she ushered
me, although partaking in the general air of decay
which pervaded the mansion and all about it, had
nevertheless been fitted up with evident attention
to comfort, and even with some dingy attempt at
luxury; but what pleased me most was that it opened,
by a second door, upon a lobby which communicated
with my fair cousin&rsquo;s apartment; a circumstance
which divested the room, in my eyes, of the air of
solitude and sadness which would otherwise have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
characterized it, to a degree almost painful to one so
dejected in spirits as I was.</p>

<p>After such arrangements as I found necessary
were completed, we both went down to the parlour,
a large wainscoted room, hung round with grim old
portraits, and, as I was not sorry to see, containing
in its ample grate a large and cheerful fire. Here
my cousin had leisure to talk more at ease; and from
her I learned something of the manners and the
habits of the two remaining members of her family,
whom I had not yet seen.</p>

<p>On my arrival I had known nothing of the family
among whom I was come to reside, except that it
consisted of three individuals, my uncle, and his son
and daughter, Lady T&mdash;&mdash;n having been long dead.
In addition to this very scanty stock of information,
I shortly learned from my communicative companion
that my uncle was, as I had suspected, completely
reserved in his habits, and besides that, having been
so far back as she could well recollect, always rather
strict (as reformed rakes frequently become), he had
latterly been growing more gloomily and sternly
religious than heretofore.</p>

<p>Her account of her brother was far less favourable,
though she did not say anything directly to his disadvantage.
From all that I could gather from her,
I was led to suppose that he was a specimen of the
idle, coarse-mannered, profligate, low-minded &ldquo;squire-archy&rdquo;&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
result which might naturally have flowed
from the circumstance of his being, as it were, outlawed
from society, and driven for companionship to
grades below his own; enjoying, too, the dangerous
prerogative of spending much money.</p>

<p>However, you may easily suppose that I found
nothing in my cousin&rsquo;s communication fully to bear
me out in so very decided a conclusion.</p>

<p>I awaited the arrival of my uncle, which was every
moment to be expected, with feelings half of alarm,
half of curiosity&mdash;a sensation which I have often
since experienced, though to a less degree, when
upon the point of standing for the first time in the
presence of one of whom I have long been in the habit
of hearing or thinking with interest.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, with some little perturbation
that I heard, first a light bustle at the outer door,
then a slow step traverse the hall, and finally witnessed
the door open, and my uncle enter the room.
He was a striking-looking man; from peculiarities
both of person and of garb, the whole effect of his
appearance amounted to extreme singularity. He
was tall, and when young his figure must have been
strikingly elegant; as it was, however, its effect was
marred by a very decided stoop. His dress was of a
sober colour, and in fashion anterior to anything
which I could remember. It was, however, handsome,
and by no means carelessly put on. But what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
completed the singularity of his appearance was his
uncut white hair, which hung in long, but not at all
neglected curls, even so far as his shoulders, and
which combined with his regularly classic features
and fine dark eyes, to bestow upon him an air of
venerable dignity and pride which I have never seen
equalled elsewhere. I rose as he entered, and met
him about the middle of the room; he kissed my
cheek and both my hands, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are most welcome, dear child, as welcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
as the command of this poor place and all that it
contains can make you. I am most rejoiced to see
you&mdash;truly rejoiced. I trust that you are not much
fatigued&mdash;pray be seated again.&rdquo; He led me to my
chair, and continued: &ldquo;I am glad to perceive you
have made acquaintance with Emily already; I see,
in your being thus brought together, the foundation
of a lasting friendship. You are both innocent, and
both young. God bless you&mdash;God bless you, and
make you all that I could wish!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill04.jpg" width="388" height="331" alt="" title="" />
<br /><span class="caption">I ROSE AS HE ENTERED.</span>
</div>

<p>He raised his eyes, and remained for a few
moments silent, as if in secret prayer. I felt that it was
impossible that this man, with feelings so quick, so
warm, so tender, could be the wretch that public
opinion had represented him to be. I was more than
ever convinced of his innocence.</p>

<p>His manner was, or appeared to me, most fascinating;
there was a mingled kindness and courtesy in
it which seemed to speak benevolence itself. It was
a manner which I felt cold art could never have
taught; it owed most of its charm to its appearing
to emanate directly from the heart; it must be a
genuine index of the owner&rsquo;s mind. So I thought.</p>

<p>My uncle having given me fully to understand
that I was most welcome, and might command whatever
was his own, pressed me to take some refreshment;
and on my refusing, he observed that previously
to bidding me good-night, he had one duty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
further to perform, one in whose observance he was
convinced I would cheerfully acquiesce.</p>

<p>He then proceeded to read a chapter from the
Bible; after which he took his leave with the same
affectionate kindness with which he had greeted me,
having repeated his desire that I should consider
everything in his house as altogether at my disposal.
It is needless to say that I was much pleased with my
uncle&mdash;it was impossible to avoid being so; and I
could not help saying to myself, if such a man as
this is not safe from the assaults of slander, who is?
I felt much happier than I had done since my father&rsquo;s
death, and enjoyed that night the first refreshing
sleep which had visited me since that event.</p>

<p>My curiosity respecting my male cousin did not
long remain unsatisfied&mdash;he appeared the next day
at dinner. His manners, though not so coarse as I
had expected, were exceedingly disagreeable; there
was an assurance and a forwardness for which I was not
prepared; there was less of the vulgarity of manner,
and almost more of that of the mind, than I had
anticipated. I felt quite uncomfortable in his presence;
there was just that confidence in his look and
tone which would read encouragement even in mere
toleration; and I felt more disgusted and annoyed at
the coarse and extravagant compliments which he was
pleased from time to time to pay me, than perhaps the
extent of the atrocity might fully have warranted. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
was, however, one consolation that he did not often
appear, being much engrossed by pursuits about
which I neither knew nor cared anything; but when
he did appear, his attentions, either with a view to
his amusement or to some more serious advantage,
were so obviously and perseveringly directed to me,
that young and inexperienced as I was, even <em>I</em> could
not be ignorant of his preference. I felt more provoked
by this odious persecution than I can express,
and discouraged him with so much vigour, that I employed
even rudeness to convince him his assiduities
were unwelcome; but all in vain.</p>

<p>This had gone on for nearly a twelvemonth, to my
infinite annoyance, when one day as I was sitting at
some needlework with my companion Emily, as was
my habit, in the parlour, the door opened, and my
cousin Edward entered the room. There was something,
I thought, odd in his manner; a kind of struggle
between shame and impudence&mdash;a kind of flurry
and ambiguity which made him appear, if possible,
more than ordinarily disagreeable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your servant, ladies,&rdquo; he said, seating himself at
the same time; &ldquo;sorry to spoil your <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>, but
never mind! I&rsquo;ll only take Emily&rsquo;s place for a minute
or two; and then we part for a while, fair cousin.
Emily, my father wants you in the corner turret. No
shilly-shally; he&rsquo;s in a hurry.&rdquo; She hesitated. &ldquo;Be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
off&mdash;tramp, march!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in a tone which
the poor girl dared not disobey.</p>

<p>She left the room, and Edward followed her to the
door. He stood there for a minute or two, as
if reflecting what he should say, perhaps satisfying
himself that no one was within hearing in the
hall.</p>

<p>At length he turned about, having closed the door,
as if carelessly, with his foot; and advancing slowly,
as if in deep thought, he took his seat at the side of
the table opposite to mine.</p>

<p>There was a brief interval of silence, after which he
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I imagine that you have a shrewd suspicion of
the object of my early visit; but I suppose I must
go into particulars. Must I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no conception,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;what your
object may be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said he, becoming more at his ease as
he proceeded, &ldquo;it may be told in a few words. You
know that it is totally impossible&mdash;quite out of the
question&mdash;that an off-hand young fellow like me, and
a good-looking girl like yourself, could meet continually,
as you and I have done, without an attachment&mdash;a
liking growing up on one side or other; in
short, I think I have let you know as plain as if I
spoke it, that I have been in love with you almost
from the first time I saw you.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>He paused; but I was too much horrified to speak.
He interpreted my silence favourably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can tell you,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m reckoned
rather hard to please, and very hard to <em>hit</em>. I can&rsquo;t
say when I was taken with a girl before; so you see
fortune reserved me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the odious wretch wound his arm round my
waist. The action at once restored me to utterance,
and with the most indignant vehemence I released
myself from his hold, and at the same time said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not been insensible, sir, of your most disagreeable
attentions&mdash;they have long been a source of
much annoyance to me; and you must be aware that
I have marked my disapprobation&mdash;my disgust&mdash;as
unequivocally as I possibly could, without actual
indelicacy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I paused, almost out of breath from the rapidity
with which I had spoken; and, without giving him
time to renew the conversation, I hastily quitted
the room, leaving him in a paroxysm of rage and mortification.</p>

<p>As I ascended the stairs, I heard him open the
parlour-door with violence, and take two or three
rapid strides in the direction in which I was moving.
I was now much frightened, and ran the whole way
until I reached my room; and having locked the
door, I listened breathlessly, but heard no sound.
This relieved me for the present; but so much had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
I been overcome by the agitation and annoyance
attendant upon the scene which I had just gone
through, that when Emily knocked at my door, I
was weeping in strong hysterics.</p>

<p>You will readily conceive my distress, when you
reflect upon my strong dislike to my cousin Edward,
combined with my youth and extreme inexperience.
Any proposal of such a nature must have agitated
me; but that it should have come from the man
whom of all others I most loathed and abhorred, and
to whom I had, as clearly as manner could do it,
expressed the state of my feelings, was almost too
overwhelming to be borne. It was a calamity, too,
in which I could not claim the sympathy of my
cousin Emily, which had always been extended to
me in my minor grievances. Still I hoped that it
might not be unattended with good; for I thought
that one inevitable and most welcome consequence
would result from this painful <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eclaircissement</i>, in the
discontinuance of my cousin&rsquo;s odious persecution.</p>

<p>When I arose next morning, it was with the fervent
hope that I might never again behold the face,
or even hear the name, of my cousin Edward; but
such a consummation, though devoutly to be wished,
was hardly likely to occur. The painful impressions
of yesterday were too vivid to be at once erased;
and I could not help feeling some dim foreboding of
coming annoyance and evil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>To expect on my suitor&rsquo;s part anything like delicacy
or consideration for me was out of the question.
I saw that he had set his heart upon my property,
and that he was not likely easily to forego such an
acquisition&mdash;possessing what might have been considered
opportunities and facilities almost to compel
my compliance.</p>

<p>I now keenly felt the unreasonableness of my
father&rsquo;s conduct in placing me to reside with a family
of all whose members, with one exception, he was
wholly ignorant, and I bitterly felt the helplessness of
my situation. I determined, however, in case of my
cousin&rsquo;s persevering in his addresses, to lay all the
particulars before my uncle (although he had never
in kindness or intimacy gone a step beyond our first
interview), and to throw myself upon his hospitality
and his sense of honour for protection against a
repetition of such scenes.</p>

<p>My cousin&rsquo;s conduct may appear to have been an
inadequate cause for such serious uneasiness; but
my alarm was caused neither by his acts nor words,
but entirely by his manner, which was strange and
even intimidating to excess. At the beginning of
yesterday&rsquo;s interview there was a sort of bullying
swagger in his air, which towards the close gave place
to the brutal vehemence of an undisguised ruffian&mdash;a
transition which had tempted me into a belief that
he might seek even forcibly to extort from me a consent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to his wishes, or by means still more horrible,
of which I scarcely dared to trust myself to think, to
possess himself of my property.</p>

<p>I was early next day summoned to attend my
uncle in his private room, which lay in a corner
turret of the old building; and thither I accordingly
went, wondering all the way what this unusual measure
might prelude. When I entered the room, he
did not rise in his usual courteous way to greet me,
but simply pointed to a chair opposite to his own. This
boded nothing agreeable. I sat down, however,
silently waiting until he should open the conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady Margaret,&rdquo; at length he said, in a tone of
greater sternness than I had thought him capable of
using, &ldquo;I have hitherto spoken to you as a friend, but
I have not forgotten that I am also your guardian,
and that my authority as such gives me a right to
control your conduct. I shall put a question to you,
and I expect and will demand a plain, direct answer.
Have I rightly been informed that you have contemptuously
rejected the suit and hand of my son
Edward?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I stammered forth with a good deal of trepidation:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe&mdash;that is, I have, sir, rejected my cousin&rsquo;s
proposals; and my coldness and discouragement
might have convinced him that I had determined to
do so.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; replied he, with suppressed, but, as it
appeared to me, intense anger, &ldquo;I have lived long
enough to know that coldness and discouragement,
and such terms, form the common cant of a worthless
coquette. You know to the full, as well as I, that
<em>coldness and discouragement</em> may be so exhibited as to
convince their object that he is neither distasteful nor
indifferent to the person who wears this manner.
You know, too, none better, that an affected neglect,
when skilfully managed, is amongst the most formidable
of the engines which artful beauty can employ.
I tell you, madam, that having, without one word
spoken in discouragement, permitted my son&rsquo;s most
marked attentions for a twelvemonth or more, you
have no right to dismiss him with no further explanation
than demurely telling him that you had
always looked coldly upon him; and neither your
wealth nor your <em>ladyship</em>&rdquo; (there was an emphasis of
scorn on the word, which would have become Sir
Giles Overreach himself) &ldquo;can warrant you in treating
with contempt the affectionate regard of an
honest heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was too much shocked at this undisguised
attempt to bully me into an acquiescence in the
interested and unprincipled plan for their own
aggrandizement, which I now perceived my uncle
and his son to have deliberately entered into, at once
to find strength or collectedness to frame an answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
to what he had said. At length I replied, with some
firmness:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In all that you have just now said, sir, you have
grossly misstated my conduct and motives. Your
information must have been most incorrect as far as
it regards my conduct towards my cousin; my manner
towards him could have conveyed nothing but dislike;
and if anything could have added to the strong
aversion which I have long felt towards him, it would
be his attempting thus to trick and frighten me into
a marriage which he knows to be revolting to me,
and which is sought by him only as a means for
securing to himself whatever property is mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I said this, I fixed my eyes upon those of my
uncle, but he was too old in the world&rsquo;s ways to falter
beneath the gaze of more searching eyes than mine;
he simply said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you acquainted with the provisions of your
father&rsquo;s will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I answered in the affirmative; and he continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you must be aware that if my son Edward
were&mdash;which God forbid&mdash;the unprincipled, reckless
man you pretend to think him&rdquo;&mdash;(here he spoke
very slowly, as if he intended that every word which
escaped him should be registered in my memory,
while at the same time the expression of his countenance
underwent a gradual but horrible change,
and the eyes which he fixed upon me became so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
darkly vivid, that I almost lost sight of everything
else)&mdash;&ldquo;if he were what you have described him,
think you, girl, he could find no briefer means than
wedding contracts to gain his ends? &rsquo;twas but to gripe
your slender neck until the breath had stopped, and
lands, and lakes, and all were his.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter1">
<img src="images/ill06.jpg" width="379" height="249" alt="" title="" />
<br /><span class="caption">&ldquo;TWAS BUT TO GRIPE YOUR SLENDER NECK UNTIL THE BREATH
HAD STOPPED.&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>I stood staring at him for many minutes after he
had ceased to speak, fascinated by the terrible
serpent-like gaze, until he continued with a welcome
change of countenance:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not speak again to you upon this topic
until one month has passed. You shall have time to
consider the relative advantages of the two courses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
which are open to you. I should be sorry to hurry
you to a decision. I am satisfied with having stated
my feelings upon the subject, and pointed out to you
the path of duty. Remember this day month&mdash;not
one word sooner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then rose, and I left the room, much agitated
and exhausted.</p>

<p>This interview, all the circumstances attending it,
but most particularly the formidable expression of
my uncle&rsquo;s countenance while he talked, though
hypothetically, of murder, combined to arouse all my
worst suspicions of him. I dreaded to look upon
the face that had so recently worn the appalling
livery of guilt and malignity. I regarded it with the
mingled fear and loathing with which one looks
upon an object which has tortured them in a nightmare.</p>

<p>In a few days after the interview, the particulars
of which I have just related, I found a note upon my
toilet-table, and on opening it I read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquo1">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Lady Margaret</span>,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be perhaps surprised to see a
strange face in your room to-day. I have dismissed
your Irish maid, and secured a French one to wait
upon you&mdash;a step rendered necessary by my proposing
shortly to visit the Continent, with all my
family.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign4">&ldquo;Your faithful guardian,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;Arthur T&mdash;&mdash;n.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>On inquiry, I found that my faithful attendant
was actually gone, and far on her way to the town
of Galway; and in her stead there appeared a tall,
raw-boned, ill-looking, elderly Frenchwoman, whose
sullen and presuming manners seemed to imply that
her vocation had never before been that of a lady&rsquo;s
maid. I could not help regarding her as a creature
of my uncle&rsquo;s, and therefore to be dreaded, even had
she been in no other way suspicious.</p>

<p>Days and weeks passed away without any, even
a momentary doubt upon my part, as to the course
to be pursued by me. The allotted period had at
length elapsed; the day arrived on which I was to
communicate my decision to my uncle. Although
my resolution had never for a moment wavered, I
could not shake off the dread of the approaching
colloquy; and my heart sank within me as I heard
the expected summons.</p>

<p>I had not seen my cousin Edward since the occurrence
of the grand <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eclaircissement</i>; he must have
studiously avoided me&mdash;I suppose from policy, it
could not have been from delicacy. I was prepared
for a terrific burst of fury from my uncle, as soon as
I should make known my determination; and I not
unreasonably feared that some act of violence or of
intimidation would next be resorted to.</p>

<p>Filled with these dreary forebodings, I fearfully
opened the study door, and the next minute I stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
in my uncle&rsquo;s presence. He received me with a
politeness which I dreaded, as arguing a favourable
anticipation respecting the answer which I was to
give; and after some slight delay, he began by
saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be a relief to both of us, I believe, to bring
this conversation as soon as possible to an issue.
You will excuse me, then, my dear niece, for speaking
with an abruptness which, under other circumstances,
would be unpardonable. You have, I am certain,
given the subject of our last interview fair and serious
consideration; and I trust that you are now prepared
with candour to lay your answer before me. A few
words will suffice&mdash;we perfectly understand one
another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused, and I, though feeling that I stood
upon a mine which might in an instant explode,
nevertheless answered with perfect composure:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must now, sir, make the same reply which I did
upon the last occasion, and I reiterate the declaration
which I then made, that I never can nor will, while
life and reason remain, consent to a union with my
cousin Edward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This announcement wrought no apparent change
in Sir Arthur, except that he became deadly, almost
lividly pale. He seemed lost in dark thought for a
minute, and then with a slight effort said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have answered me honestly and directly;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and you say your resolution is unchangeable. Well,
would it had been otherwise&mdash;would it had been
otherwise; but be it as it is, I am satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave me his hand&mdash;it was cold and damp as
death; under an assumed calmness, it was evident
that he was fearfully agitated. He continued to hold
my hand with an almost painful pressure, while, as if
unconsciously, seeming to forget my presence, he
muttered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange, strange, strange, indeed! fatuity, helpless
fatuity!&rdquo; there was here a long pause. &ldquo;Madness
indeed to strain a cable that is rotten to the very
heart&mdash;it must break&mdash;and then&mdash;all goes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was again a pause of some minutes, after
which, suddenly changing his voice and manner to
one of wakeful alacrity, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Margaret, my son Edward shall plague you no
more. He leaves this country on to-morrow for
France&mdash;he shall speak no more upon this subject&mdash;never,
never more&mdash;whatever events depended upon
your answer must now take their own course; but,
as for this fruitless proposal, it has been tried enough;
it can be repeated no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At these words he coldly suffered my hand to
drop, as if to express his total abandonment of all
his projected schemes of alliance; and certainly the
action, with the accompanying words, produced upon
my mind a more solemn and depressing effect than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
I believed possible to have been caused by the course
which I had determined to pursue; it struck upon
my heart with an awe and heaviness which <em>will</em>
accompany the accomplishment of an important and
irrevocable act, even though no doubt or scruple
remains to make it possible that the agent should
wish it undone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said my uncle, after a little time, &ldquo;we now
cease to speak upon this topic, never to resume it
again. Remember you shall have no further uneasiness
from Edward; he leaves Ireland for France
on to-morrow; this will be a relief to you. May I
depend upon your honour that no word touching the
subject of this interview shall ever escape you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I gave him the desired assurance; he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well&mdash;I am satisfied; we have nothing more,
I believe, to say upon either side, and my presence
must be a restraint upon you, I shall therefore bid
you farewell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I then left the apartment, scarcely knowing what
to think of the strange interview which had just taken
place.</p>

<p>On the next day my uncle took occasion to tell
me that Edward had actually sailed, if his intention
had not been interfered with by adverse circumstances;
and two days subsequently he actually
produced a letter from his son, written, as it said, on
board, and despatched while the ship was getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
under weigh. This was a great satisfaction to me
and as being likely to prove so, it was no doubt
communicated to me by Sir Arthur.</p>

<p>During all this trying period, I had found infinite
consolation in the society and sympathy of my dear
cousin Emily. I never in after-life formed a friendship
so close, so fervent, and upon which, in all its
progress, I could look back with feelings of such
unalloyed pleasure, upon whose termination I must
ever dwell with so deep, yet so unembittered regret.
In cheerful converse with her I soon recovered my
spirits considerably, and passed my time agreeably
enough, although still in the strictest seclusion.</p>

<p>Matters went on sufficiently smooth, although I
could not help sometimes feeling a momentary, but
horrible uncertainty respecting my uncle&rsquo;s character;
which was not altogether unwarranted by the circumstances
of the two trying interviews whose
particulars I have just detailed. The unpleasant
impression which these conferences were calculated
to leave upon my mind was fast wearing away,
when there occurred a circumstance, slight indeed in
itself, but calculated irresistibly to awaken all my
worst suspicions, and to overwhelm me again with
anxiety and terror.</p>

<p>I had one day left the house with my cousin Emily,
in order to take a ramble of considerable length, for
the purpose of sketching some favourite views, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
she had walked about half a mile, when I perceived
that we had forgotten our drawing materials, the
absence of which would have defeated the object of
our walk. Laughing at our own thoughtlessness, we
returned to the house, and leaving Emily without, I
ran upstairs to procure the drawing-books and pencils,
which lay in my bedroom.</p>

<p>As I ran up the stairs I was met by the tall, ill-looking
Frenchwoman, evidently a good deal flurried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Que veut, madame?&rdquo; said she, with a more decided
effort to be polite than I had ever known her
make before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no&mdash;no matter,&rdquo; said I, hastily running by
her in the direction of my room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; cried she, in a high key, &ldquo;restez ici,
s&rsquo;il vous plait; votre chambre n&rsquo;est pas faite&mdash;your
room is not ready for your reception yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I continued to move on without heeding her. She
was some way behind me, and feeling that she could
not otherwise prevent my entrance, for I was now
upon the very lobby, she made a desperate attempt
to seize hold of my person: she succeeded in grasping
the end of my shawl, which she drew from my
shoulders; but slipping at the same time upon the
polished oak floor, she fell at full length upon the
boards.</p>

<p>A little frightened as well as angry at the rudeness
of this strange woman, I hastily pushed open the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
door of my room, at which I now stood, in order to
escape from her; but great was my amazement on
entering to find the apartment occupied.</p>

<p>The window was open, and beside it stood two
male figures; they appeared to be examining the
fastenings of the casement, and their backs were
turned towards the door. One of them was my
uncle; they both turned on my entrance, as if
startled. The stranger was booted and cloaked, and
wore a heavy broad-leafed hat over his brows. He
turned but for a moment, and averted his face; but I
had seen enough to convince me that he was no other
than my cousin Edward. My uncle had some iron
instrument in his hand, which he hastily concealed
behind his back; and, coming towards me, said something
as if in an explanatory tone; but I was too
much shocked and confounded to understand what
it might be. He said something about &ldquo;repairs&mdash;window-frames&mdash;cold,
and safety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did not wait, however, to ask or to receive explanations,
but hastily left the room. As I went
down the stairs I thought I heard the voice of the
French woman in all the shrill volubility of excuse,
which was met, however, by suppressed but vehement
imprecations, or what seemed to me to be such,
in which the voice of my cousin Edward distinctly
mingled.</p>

<p>I joined my cousin Emily quite out of breath. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
need not say that my head was too full of other
things to think much of drawing for that day. I
imparted to her frankly the cause of my alarms, but
at the same time as gently as I could; and with tears
she promised vigilance, and devotion, and love. I
never had reason for a moment to repent the unreserved
confidence which I then reposed in her.
She was no less surprised than I at the unexpected
appearance of her brother, whose departure for France
neither of us had for a moment doubted, but which
was now proved by his actual presence to be nothing
more than an imposture, practised, I feared, for no
good end.</p>

<p>The situation in which I had found my uncle had
removed completely all my doubts as to his designs.
I magnified suspicions into certainties, and dreaded
night after night that I should be murdered in my
bed. The nervousness produced by sleepless nights
and days of anxious fears increased the horrors of
my situation to such a degree, that I at length wrote
a letter to a Mr. Jefferies, an old and faithful friend of
my father&rsquo;s, and perfectly acquainted with all his affairs,
praying him, for God&rsquo;s sake, to relieve me from my
present terrible situation, and communicating without
reserve the nature and grounds of my suspicions.</p>

<p>This letter I kept sealed and directed for two or
three days always about my person&mdash;for discovery
would have been ruinous&mdash;in expectation of an opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
which might be safely trusted, whereby to have
it placed in the post-office. As neither Emily nor I
was permitted to pass beyond the precincts of the
demesne itself, which was surrounded by high walls
formed of dry stone, the difficulty of procuring such
an opportunity was greatly enhanced.</p>

<p>At this time Emily had a short conversation with
her father, which she reported to me instantly.</p>

<p>After some indifferent matter, he had asked her
whether she and I were upon good terms, and
whether I was unreserved in my disposition. She
answered in the affirmative; and he then inquired
whether I had been much surprised to find him in
my chamber on the other day. She answered that I
had been both surprised and amused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what did she think of George Wilson&rsquo;s
appearance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; inquired she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the architect,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;who is to contract
for the repairs of the house; he is accounted a
handsome fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She could not see his face,&rdquo; said Emily, &ldquo;and she
was in such a hurry to escape that she scarcely
noticed him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Arthur appeared satisfied, and the conversation
ended.</p>

<p>This slight conversation, repeated accurately to me
by Emily, had the effect of confirming, if indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
anything was required to do so, all that I had before
believed as to Edward&rsquo;s actual presence; and I
naturally became, if possible, more anxious than
ever to despatch the letter to Mr. Jefferies. An
opportunity at length occurred.</p>

<p>As Emily and I were walking one day near the
gate of the demesne, a man from the village happened
to be passing down the avenue from the house; the
spot was secluded, and as this person was not connected
by service with those whose observation I
dreaded, I committed the letter to his keeping, with
strict injunctions that he should put it without delay
into the receiver of the town post-office; at the same
time I added a suitable gratuity, and the man,
having made many protestations of punctuality, was
soon out of sight.</p>

<p>He was hardly gone when I began to doubt my
discretion in having trusted this person; but I had
no better or safer means of despatching the letter,
and I was not warranted in suspecting him of such
wanton dishonesty as an inclination to tamper with
it; but I could not be quite satisfied of its safety
until I had received an answer, which could not
arrive for a few days. Before I did, however, an
event occurred which a little surprised me.</p>

<p>I was sitting in my bedroom early in the day,
reading by myself, when I heard a knock at the
door.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said I; and my uncle entered the
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you excuse me?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I sought you
in the parlour, and thence I have come here. I
desire to say a word with you. I trust that you have
hitherto found my conduct to you such as that of a
guardian towards his ward should be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I dared not withhold my assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I trust that you have not
found me harsh or unjust, and that you have perceived,
my dear niece, that I have sought to make
this poor place as agreeable to you as may be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I assented again; and he put his hand in his
pocket, whence he drew a folded paper, and dashing
it upon the table with startling emphasis, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you write that letter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sudden and fearful alteration of his voice,
manner, and face, but, more than all, the unexpected
production of my letter to Mr. Jefferies, which I at
once recognized, so confounded and terrified me that
I felt almost choking.</p>

<p>I could not utter a word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you write that letter?&rdquo; he repeated, with
slow and intense emphasis. &ldquo;You did, liar and
hypocrite! You dared to write this foul and infamous
libel; but it shall be your last. Men will
universally believe you mad, if I choose to call for
an inquiry. I can make you appear so. The suspicions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
expressed in this letter are the hallucinations
and alarms of moping lunacy. I have defeated your
first attempt, madam; and by the holy God, if ever
you make another, chains, straw, darkness, and the
keeper&rsquo;s whip shall be your lasting portion!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these astounding words he left the room,
leaving me almost fainting.</p>

<p>I was now almost reduced to despair; my last cast
had failed; I had no course left but that of eloping
secretly from the castle and placing myself under
the protection of the nearest magistrate. I felt if
this were not done, and speedily, that I should be
<em>murdered</em>.</p>

<p>No one, from mere description, can have an idea
of the unmitigated horror of my situation&mdash;a helpless,
weak, inexperienced girl, placed under the power and
wholly at the mercy of evil men, and feeling that she
had it not in her power to escape for a moment from
the malignant influences under which she was probably
fated to fall; and with a consciousness that if
violence, if murder were designed, her dying shriek
would be lost in void space; no human being would
be near to aid her, no human interposition could
deliver her.</p>

<p>I had seen Edward but once during his visit, and,
as I did not meet with him again, I began to think
that he must have taken his departure&mdash;a conviction
which was to a certain degree satisfactory, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
regarded his absence as indicating the removal of
immediate danger.</p>

<p>Emily also arrived circuitously at the same conclusion,
and not without good grounds, for she managed
indirectly to learn that Edward&rsquo;s black horse had
actually been for a day and part of a night in the
castle stables, just at the time of her brother&rsquo;s supposed
visit. The horse had gone and, as she argued,
the rider must have departed with it.</p>

<p>This point being so far settled, I felt a little less
uncomfortable; when, being one day alone in my
bedroom, I happened to look out from the window,
and, to my unutterable horror, I beheld, peering
through an opposite casement, my cousin Edward&rsquo;s
face. Had I seen the evil one himself in bodily
shape, I could not have experienced a more sickening
revulsion.</p>

<p>I was too much appalled to move at once from the
window, but I did so soon enough to avoid his eye.
He was looking fixedly into the narrow quadrangle
upon which the window opened. I shrank back unperceived,
to pass the rest of the day in terror and
despair. I went to my room early that night, but I
was too miserable to sleep.</p>

<p>At about twelve o&rsquo;clock, feeling very nervous, I
determined to call my cousin Emily, who slept, you
will remember, in the next room, which communicated
with mine by a second door. By this private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
entrance I found my way into her chamber, and
without difficulty persuaded her to return to my
room and sleep with me. We accordingly lay down
together, she undressed, and I with my clothes on,
for I was every moment walking up and down the
room, and felt too nervous and miserable to think of
rest or comfort.</p>

<p>Emily was soon fast asleep, and I lay awake, fervently
longing for the first pale gleam of morning;
reckoning every stroke of the old clock with an
impatience which made every hour appear like six.</p>

<p>It must have been about one o&rsquo;clock when I
thought I heard a slight noise at the partition-door
between Emily&rsquo;s room and mine, as if caused by
somebody turning the key in the lock. I held my
breath, and the same sound was repeated at the
second door of my room&mdash;that which opened upon
the lobby&mdash;the sound was here distinctly caused by
the revolution of the bolt in the lock, and it was
followed by a slight pressure upon the door itself, as
if to ascertain the security of the lock.</p>

<p>The person, whoever it might be, was probably
satisfied, for I heard the old boards of the lobby
creak and strain, as if under the weight of somebody
moving cautiously over them. My sense of hearing
became unnaturally, almost painfully acute. I
suppose my imagination added distinctness to sounds
vague in themselves. I thought that I could actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
hear the breathing of the person who was slowly
returning down the lobby. At the head of the
staircase there appeared to occur a pause; and I
could distinctly hear two or three sentences hastily
whispered; the steps then descended the stairs with
apparently less caution. I now ventured to walk
quickly and lightly to the lobby door, and attempted
to open it; it was indeed fast locked upon the outside,
as was also the other.</p>

<p>I now felt that the dreadful hour was come; but
one desperate expedient remained&mdash;it was to awaken
Emily, and by our united strength to attempt to
force the partition-door, which was slighter than the
other, and through this to pass to the lower part of
the house, whence it might be possible to escape to
the grounds, and forth to the village.</p>

<p>I returned to the bedside and shook Emily, but
in vain. Nothing that I could do availed to produce
from her more than a few incoherent words&mdash;it was
a deathlike sleep. She had certainly drunk of some
narcotic, as had I probably also, spite of all the
caution with which I had examined everything presented
to us to eat or drink.</p>

<p>I now attempted, with as little noise as possible,
to force first one door, then the other; but all in
vain. I believe no strength could have effected my
object, for both doors opened inwards. I therefore
collected whatever movables I could carry thither,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and piled them against the doors, so as to assist me
in whatever attempts I should make to resist the
entrance of those without. I then returned to the
bed and endeavoured again, but fruitlessly, to awaken
my cousin. It was not sleep, it was torpor, lethargy,
death. I knelt down and prayed with an agony of
earnestness; and then seating myself upon the bed,
I awaited my fate with a kind of terrible tranquillity.</p>

<p>I heard a faint clanking sound from the narrow
court which I have already mentioned, as if caused
by the scraping of some iron instrument against
stones or rubbish. I at first determined not to disturb
the calmness which I now felt by uselessly
watching the proceedings of those who sought my
life; but as the sounds continued, the horrible
curiosity which I felt overcame every other emotion,
and I determined, at all hazards, to gratify it. I
therefore crawled upon my knees to the window, so
as to let the smallest portion of my head appear
above the sill.</p>

<p>The moon was shining with an uncertain radiance
upon the antique grey buildings, and obliquely upon
the narrow court beneath, one side of which was
therefore clearly illuminated, while the other was lost
in obscurity; the sharp outlines of the old gables,
with their nodding clusters of ivy, being at first alone
visible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Whoever or whatever occasioned the noise which
had excited my curiosity, was concealed under the
shadow of the dark side of the quadrangle. I placed
my hand over my eyes to shade them from the
moonlight, which was so bright as to be almost
dazzling, and, peering into the darkness, I first dimly,
but afterwards gradually almost with full distinctness,
beheld the form of a man engaged in digging what
appeared to be a rude hole close under the wall.
Some implements, probably a shovel and pickaxe,
lay beside him, and to these he every now and then
applied himself as the nature of the ground required.
He pursued his task rapidly, and with as little noise
as possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; thought I, as, shovelful after shovelful, the
dislodged rubbish mounted into a heap, &ldquo;they are
digging the grave in which, before two hours pass, I
must lie, a cold, mangled corpse. I am <em>theirs</em>&mdash;I
cannot escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt as if my reason was leaving me. I started
to my feet, and in mere despair I applied myself
again to each of the two doors alternately. I
strained every nerve and sinew, but I might as well
have attempted, with my single strength, to force the
building itself from its foundation. I threw myself
madly upon the ground, and clasped my hands
over my eyes as if to shut out the horrible images
which crowded upon me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>The paroxysm passed away. I prayed once more,
with the bitter, agonized fervour of one who feels
that the hour of death is present and inevitable.
When I arose, I went once more to the window and
looked out, just in time to see a shadowy figure glide
stealthily along the wall. The task was finished.
The catastrophe of the tragedy must soon be accomplished.</p>

<p>I determined now to defend my life to the last;
and that I might be able to do so with some effect, I
searched the room for something which might serve
as a weapon; but either through accident, or from
an anticipation of such a possibility, everything
which might have been made available for such a
purpose had been carefully removed. I must then
die tamely, and without an effort to defend myself.</p>

<p>A thought suddenly struck me&mdash;might it not be
possible to escape through the door, which the
assassin must open in order to enter the room? I
resolved to make the attempt. I felt assured that
the door through which ingress to the room would
be effected was that which opened upon the lobby.
It was the more direct way, besides being, for obvious
reasons, less liable to interruption than the other.
I resolved, then, to place myself behind a projection
of the wall, whose shadow would serve fully to conceal
me, and when the door should be opened, and
before they should have discovered the identity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the occupant of the bed, to creep noiselessly from
the room, and then to trust to Providence for escape.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate this scheme, I removed all
the lumber which I had heaped against the door;
and I had nearly completed my arrangements, when
I perceived the room suddenly darkened by the
close approach of some shadowy object to the
window. On turning my eyes in that direction, I
observed at the top of the casement, as if suspended
from above, first the feet, then the legs, then the
body, and at length the whole figure of a man
present himself. It was Edward T&mdash;&mdash;n.</p>

<p>He appeared to be guiding his descent so as to
bring his feet upon the centre of the stone block
which occupied the lower part of the window; and,
having secured his footing upon this, he kneeled
down and began to gaze into the room. As the
moon was gleaming into the chamber, and the bed-curtains
were drawn, he was able to distinguish the
bed itself and its contents. He appeared satisfied
with his scrutiny, for he looked up and made a sign
with his hand, upon which the rope by which his
descent had been effected was slackened from above,
and he proceeded to disengage it from his waist; this
accomplished, he applied his hands to the window-frame,
which must have been ingeniously contrived
for the purpose, for, with apparently no resistance,
the whole frame, containing casement and all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
slipped from its position in the wall, and was by him
lowered into the room.</p>

<p>The cold night wind waved the bed-curtains, and
he paused for a moment; all was still again, and
he stepped in upon the floor of the room. He held
in his hand what appeared to be a steel instrument,
shaped something like a hammer, but larger and
sharper at the extremities. This he held rather
behind him, while, with three long, tip-toe strides, he
brought himself to the bedside.</p>

<p>I felt that the discovery must now be made, and
held my breath in momentary expectation of the
execration in which he would vent his surprise and
disappointment. I closed my eyes&mdash;there was a
pause, but it was a short one. I heard two dull
blows, given in rapid succession: a quivering sigh,
and the long-drawn, heavy breathing of the sleeper
was for ever suspended. I unclosed my eyes, and
saw the murderer fling the quilt across the head of
his victim: he then, with the instrument of death
still in his hand, proceeded to the lobby door, upon
which he tapped sharply twice or thrice. A quick
step was then heard approaching, and a voice whispered
something from without. Edward answered,
with a kind of chuckle, &ldquo;Her ladyship is past complaining;
unlock the door, in the devil&rsquo;s name,
unless you&rsquo;re afraid to come in, and help me to lift
the body out of the window.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>The key was turned in the lock&mdash;the door opened,
and my uncle entered the room.</p>

<p>I have told you already that I had placed myself
under the shade of a projection of the wall, close to
the door. I had instinctively shrunk down, cowering
towards the ground, on the entrance of Edward
through the window. When my uncle entered the
room, he and his son both stood so very close to me
that his hand was every moment upon the point of
touching my face. I held my breath, and remained
motionless as death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had no interruption from the next room?&rdquo;
said my uncle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the brief reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Secure the jewels, Ned; the French harpy must
not lay her claws upon them. You&rsquo;re a steady hand,
by G&mdash;&mdash;! not much blood&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not twenty drops,&rdquo; replied his son, &ldquo;and those
on the quilt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; whispered my uncle again.
&ldquo;We must lift the&mdash;the <em>thing</em> through the window
and lay the rubbish over it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They then turned to the bedside, and, winding the
bed-clothes round the body, carried it between them
slowly to the window, and, exchanging a few brief
words with some one below, they shoved it over the
window-sill, and I heard it fall heavily on the ground
underneath.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the jewels,&rdquo; said my uncle; &ldquo;there are
two caskets in the lower drawer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He proceeded, with an accuracy which, had I been
more at ease, would have furnished me with matter
of astonishment, to lay his hand upon the very spot
where my jewels lay; and having possessed himself
of them, he called to his son:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the rope made fast above?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a fool&mdash;to be sure it is,&rdquo; replied he.</p>

<p>They then lowered themselves from the window.
I now rose lightly and cautiously, scarcely daring to
breathe, from my place of concealment, and was
creeping towards the door, when I heard my cousin&rsquo;s
voice, in a sharp whisper, exclaim: &ldquo;Scramble up
again! G&mdash;d d&mdash;&mdash;n you, you&rsquo;ve forgot to lock the
room-door!&rdquo; and I perceived, by the straining of the
rope which hung from above, that the mandate was
instantly obeyed.</p>

<p>Not a second was to be lost. I passed through the
door, which was only closed, and moved as rapidly
as I could, consistently with stillness, along the lobby.
Before I had gone many yards, I heard the door
through which I had just passed double-locked on
the inside. I glided down the stairs in terror, lest, at
every corner, I should meet the murderer or one of
his accomplices.</p>

<p>I reached the hall, and listened for a moment, to
ascertain whether all was silent around; no sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
was audible. The parlour windows opened on the
park, and through one of them I might, I thought,
easily effect my escape. Accordingly, I hastily
entered; but, to my consternation, a candle was
burning in the room, and by its light I saw a figure
seated at the dinner-table, upon which lay glasses,
bottles, and the other accompaniments of a drinking-party.
Two or three chairs were placed about the
table irregularly, as if hastily abandoned by their
occupants.</p>

<p>A single glance satisfied me that the figure was
that of my French attendant. She was fast asleep,
having probably drunk deeply. There was something
malignant and ghastly in the calmness of this
bad woman&rsquo;s features, dimly illuminated as they were
by the flickering blaze of the candle. A knife lay
upon the table, and the terrible thought, struck me&mdash;&ldquo;Should
I kill this sleeping accomplice, and thus
secure my retreat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing could be easier&mdash;it was but to draw the
blade across her throat&mdash;the work of a second. An
instant&rsquo;s pause, however, corrected me. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
thought I, &ldquo;the God who has conducted me thus far
through the valley of the shadow of death, will not
abandon me now. I will fall into their hands, or I
will escape hence, but it shall be free from the stain
of blood. His will be done!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt a confidence arising from this reflection, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
assurance of protection which I cannot describe.
There was no other means of escape, so I advanced,
with a firm step and collected mind, to the window.
I noiselessly withdrew the bars and unclosed the
shutters&mdash;I pushed open the casement, and, without
waiting to look behind me, I ran with my utmost
speed, scarcely feeling the ground under me, down
the avenue, taking care to keep upon the grass which
bordered it.</p>

<p>I did not for a moment slacken my speed, and I
had now gained the centre point between the park-gate
and the mansion-house. Here the avenue made a
wider circuit, and in order to avoid delay, I directed
my way across the smooth sward round which the
pathway wound, intending, at the opposite side of the
flat, at a point which I distinguished by a group of
old birch-trees, to enter again upon the beaten track,
which was from thence tolerably direct to the gate.</p>

<p>I had, with my utmost speed, got about half way
across this broad flat, when the rapid treading of a
horse&rsquo;s hoofs struck upon my ear. My heart swelled
in my bosom as though I would smother. The
clattering of galloping hoofs approached&mdash;I was
pursued&mdash;they were now upon the sward on which I
was running&mdash;there was not a bush or a bramble to
shelter me&mdash;and, as if to render escape altogether
desperate, the moon, which had hitherto been obscured,
at this moment shone forth with a broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
clear light, which made every object distinctly
visible.</p>

<p>The sounds were now close behind me. I felt my
knees bending under me, with the sensation which
torments one in dreams. I reeled&mdash;I stumbled&mdash;I
fell&mdash;and at the same instant the cause of my alarm
wheeled past me at full gallop. It was one of the
young fillies which pastured loose about the park,
whose frolics had thus all but maddened me with
terror. I scrambled to my feet, and rushed on with
weak but rapid steps, my sportive companion still
galloping round and round me with many a frisk and
fling, until, at length, more dead than alive, I reached
the avenue-gate, and crossed the stile, I scarce knew
how.</p>

<p>I ran through the village, in which all was silent
as the grave, until my progress was arrested by the
hoarse voice of a sentinel, who cried, &ldquo;Who goes
there?&rdquo; I felt that I was now safe. I turned in the
direction of the voice, and fell fainting at the soldier&rsquo;s
feet. When I came to myself, I was sitting in a
miserable hovel, surrounded by strange faces, all
bespeaking curiosity and compassion.</p>

<p>Many soldiers were in it also: indeed, as I afterwards
found, it was employed as a guard-room by a
detachment of troops quartered for that night in the
town. In a few words I informed their officer of the
circumstances which had occurred, describing also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the appearance of the persons engaged in the murder;
and he, without loss of time, proceeded to the mansion-house
of Carrickleigh, taking with him a party of his
men. But the villains had discovered their mistake,
and had effected their escape before the arrival of
the military.</p>

<p>The Frenchwoman was, however, arrested in the
neighbourhood upon the next day. She was tried
and condemned upon the ensuing assizes; and previous
to her execution, confessed that &ldquo;<em>she had a
hand in making Hugh Tisdall&rsquo;s bed</em>.&rdquo; She had been
a housekeeper in the castle at the time, and a kind of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chère amie</i> of my uncle&rsquo;s. She was, in reality, able to
speak English like a native, but had exclusively used
the French language, I suppose, to facilitate her
disguise. She died the same hardened wretch
she had lived, confessing her crimes only, as she
alleged, that her doing so might involve Sir Arthur
T&mdash;&mdash;n, the great author of her guilt and misery, and
whom she now regarded with unmitigated detestation.</p>

<p>With the particulars of Sir Arthur&rsquo;s and his son&rsquo;s
escape, as far as they are known, you are acquainted.
You are also in possession of their after fate&mdash;the
terrible, the tremendous retribution which, after long
delays of many years, finally overtook and crushed
them. Wonderful and inscrutable are the dealings
of God with His creatures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Deep and fervent as must always be my gratitude
to Heaven for my deliverance, effected by a chain of
providential occurrences, the failing of a single link
of which must have ensured my destruction, I was
long before I could look back upon it with other
feelings than those of bitterness, almost of agony.
The only being that had ever really loved me, my
nearest and dearest friend, ever ready to sympathize,
to counsel, and to assist&mdash;the gayest, the gentlest,
the warmest heart; the only creature on earth that
cared for me&mdash;<em>her</em> life had been the price of my
deliverance; and I then uttered the wish, which no
event of my long and sorrowful life has taught me
to recall, that she had been spared, and that, in
her stead, <em>I</em> were mouldering in the grave, forgotten
and at rest.</p>

</div>


<p>You will no doubt be surprised, my dear friend, at
the subject of the following narrative. What had I
to do with Schalken, or Schalken with me? He
had returned to his native land, and was probably
dead and buried before I was born; I never visited
Holland, nor spoke with a native of that country.
So much I believe you already know. I must, then,
give you my authority, and state to you frankly the
ground upon which rests the credibility of the strange
story which I am about to lay before you.</p>

<p>I was acquainted, in my early days, with a Captain
Vandael, whose father had served King William in
the Low Countries, and also in my own unhappy
land during the Irish campaigns. I know not how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
it happened that I liked this man&rsquo;s society, spite of
his politics and religion: but so it was; and it was
by means of the free intercourse to which our intimacy
gave rise that I became possessed of the curious
tale which you are about to hear.</p>

<p>I had often been struck, while visiting Vandael,
by a remarkable picture, in which, though no <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">connoisseur</i>
myself, I could not fail to discern some very
strong peculiarities, particularly in the distribution of
light and shade, as also a certain oddity in the design
itself, which interested my curiosity. It represented
the interior of what might be a chamber in some
antique religious building&mdash;the foreground was occupied
by a female figure, arrayed in a species of white
robe, part of which was arranged so as to form a veil.
The dress, however, was not strictly that of any religious
order. In its hand the figure bore a lamp, by
whose light alone the form and face were illuminated;
the features were marked by an arch smile, such as
pretty women wear when engaged in successfully
practising some roguish trick; in the background,
and (excepting where the dim red light of an expiring
fire serves to define the form) totally in the shade,
stood the figure of a man equipped in the old fashion,
with doublet and so forth, in an attitude of alarm, his
hand being placed upon the hilt of his sword, which
he appeared to be in the act of drawing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are some pictures,&rdquo; said I to my friend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
&ldquo;which impress one, I know not how, with a conviction
that they represent not the mere ideal shapes
and combinations which have floated through the
imagination of the artist, but scenes, faces, and situations
which have actually existed. When I look
upon that picture, something assures me that I
behold the representation of a reality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vandael smiled, and, fixing his eyes upon the
painting musingly, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your fancy has not deceived you, my good friend,
for that picture is the record, and I believe a faithful
one, of a remarkable and mysterious occurrence. It
was painted by Schalken, and contains, in the face
of the female figure which occupies the most prominent
place in the design, an accurate portrait of Rose
Velderkaust, the niece of Gerard Douw, the first and,
I believe, the only love of Godfrey Schalken. My
father knew the painter well, and from Schalken himself
he learned the story of the mysterious drama,
one scene of which the picture has embodied. This
painting, which is accounted a fine specimen of
Schalken&rsquo;s style, was bequeathed to my father by
the artist&rsquo;s will, and, as you have observed, is a very
striking and interesting production.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had only to request Vandael to tell the story of
the painting in order to be gratified; and thus it is
that I am enabled to submit to you a faithful recital
of what I heard myself, leaving you to reject or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
allow the evidence upon which the truth of the tradition
depends&mdash;with this one assurance, that Schalken
was an honest, blunt Dutchman, and, I believe,
wholly incapable of committing a flight of imagination;
and further, that Vandael, from whom I heard
the story, appeared firmly convinced of its truth.</p>

<p>There are few forms upon which the mantle of
mystery and romance could seem to hang more ungracefully
than upon that of the uncouth and clownish
Schalken&mdash;the Dutch boor&mdash;the rude and dogged,
but most cunning worker in oils, whose pieces delight
the initiated of the present day almost as much as his
manners disgusted the refined of his own; and yet
this man, so rude, so dogged, so slovenly, I had
almost said so savage in mien and manner, during
his after successes, had been selected by the capricious
goddess, in his early life, to figure as the hero
of a romance by no means devoid of interest or of
mystery.</p>

<p>Who can tell how meet he may have been in his
young days to play the part of the lover or of the
hero? who can say that in early life he had been the
same harsh, unlicked, and rugged boor that, in his
maturer age, he proved? or how far the neglected
rudeness which afterwards marked his air, and garb,
and manners, may not have been the growth of that
reckless apathy not unfrequently produced by bitter
misfortunes and disappointments in early life?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>These questions can never now be answered.</p>

<p>We must content ourselves, then, with a plain
statement of facts, leaving matters of speculation to
those who like them.</p>

<p>When Schalken studied under the immortal Gerard
Douw, he was a young man; and in spite of the
phlegmatic constitution and excitable manner which
he shared, we believe, with his countrymen, he was
not incapable of deep and vivid impressions, for it is
an established fact that the young painter looked
with considerable interest upon the beautiful niece of
his wealthy master.</p>

<p>Rose Velderkaust was very young, having, at the
period of which we speak, not yet attained her seventeenth
year; and, if tradition speaks truth, she possessed
all the soft dimpling charms of the fair, light-haired
Flemish maidens. Schalken had not studied long in
the school of Gerard Douw when he felt this interest
deepening into something of a keener and intenser
feeling than was quite consistent with the tranquillity
of his honest Dutch heart; and at the same time he
perceived, or thought he perceived, flattering symptoms
of a reciprocal attachment, and this was quite
sufficient to determine whatever indecision he might
have heretofore experienced, and to lead him to
devote exclusively to her every hope and feeling of
his heart. In short, he was as much in love as a
Dutchman could be. He was not long in making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
his passion known to the pretty maiden herself, and
his declaration was followed by a corresponding confession
upon her part.</p>

<p>Schalken, howbeit, was a poor man, and he possessed
no counterbalancing advantages of birth or
position to induce the old man to consent to a union
which must involve his niece and ward in the strugglings
and difficulties of a young and nearly friendless
artist. He was, therefore, to wait until time had
furnished him with opportunity, and accident with
success; and then, if his labours were found sufficiently
lucrative, it was to be hoped that his proposals
might at least be listened to by her jealous guardian.
Months passed away, and, cheered by the smiles of
the little Rose, Schalken&rsquo;s labours were redoubled,
and with such effect and improvement as reasonably
to promise the realization of his hopes, and no contemptible
eminence in his art, before many years
should have elapsed.</p>

<p>The even course of this cheering prosperity was,
unfortunately, destined to experience a sudden and formidable
interruption, and that, too, in a manner so
strange and mysterious as to baffle all investigation,
and throw upon the events themselves a shadow of
almost supernatural horror.</p>

<p>Schalken had one evening remained in the master&rsquo;s
studio considerably longer than his more volatile
companions, who had gladly availed themselves of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the excuse which the dusk of evening afforded to
withdraw from their several tasks, in order to finish
a day of labour in the jollity and conviviality of the
tavern.</p>

<p>But Schalken worked for improvement, or rather
for love. Besides, he was now engaged merely in
sketching a design, an operation which, unlike that
of colouring, might be continued as long as there was
light sufficient to distinguish between canvas and
charcoal. He had not then, nor, indeed, until long
after, discovered the peculiar powers of his pencil;
and he was engaged in composing a group of extremely
roguish-looking and grotesque imps and
demons, who were inflicting various ingenious torments
upon a perspiring and pot-bellied St. Anthony,
who reclined in the midst of them, apparently in the
last stage of drunkenness.</p>

<p>The young artist, however, though incapable of
executing, or even of appreciating, anything of true
sublimity, had nevertheless discernment enough to
prevent his being by any means satisfied with his
work; and many were the patient erasures and corrections
which the limbs and features of saint and
devil underwent, yet all without producing in their
new arrangement anything of improvement or increased
effect.</p>

<p>The large, old-fashioned room was silent, and,
with the exception of himself, quite deserted by its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
usual inmates. An hour had passed&mdash;nearly two&mdash;without
any improved result. Daylight had already
declined, and twilight was fast giving way to the
darkness of night. The patience of the young man
was exhausted, and he stood before his unfinished
production, absorbed in no very pleasing ruminations,
one hand buried in the folds of his long dark hair,
and the other holding the piece of charcoal which
had so ill executed its office, and which he now
rubbed, without much regard to the sable streaks
which it produced, with irritable pressure upon his
ample Flemish inexpressibles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said the young man aloud, &ldquo;would that
picture, devils, saint, and all, were where they should
be&mdash;in hell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A short, sudden laugh, uttered startlingly close to
his ear, instantly responded to the ejaculation.</p>

<p>The artist turned sharply round, and now for the
first time became aware that his labours had been
overlooked by a stranger.</p>

<p>Within about a yard and a half, and rather behind
him, there stood what was, or appeared to be, the
figure of an elderly man: he wore a short cloak, and
broad-brimmed hat with a conical crown, and in his
hand, which was protected with a heavy, gauntlet-shaped
glove, he carried a long ebony walking-stick,
surmounted with what appeared, as it glittered dimly
in the twilight to be a massive head of gold; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
upon his breast, through the folds of the cloak,
there shone the links of a rich chain of the same
metal.</p>

<p>The room was so obscure that nothing further of
the appearance of the figure could be ascertained,
and the face was altogether overshadowed by the
heavy flap of the beaver which overhung it, so that no
feature could be clearly discerned. A quantity of dark
hair escaped from beneath this sombre hat, a circumstance
which, connected with the firm, upright
carriage of the intruder, proved that his years could
not yet exceed threescore or thereabouts.</p>

<p>There was an air of gravity and importance about
the garb of this person, and something indescribably
odd&mdash;I might say awful&mdash;in the perfect, stone-like
movelessness of the figure, that effectually checked
the testy comment which had at once risen to the
lips of the irritated artist. He therefore, as soon as
he had sufficiently recovered the surprise, asked the
stranger, civilly, to be seated, and desired to know if
he had any message to leave for his master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell Gerard Douw,&rdquo; said the unknown, without
altering his attitude in the smallest degree, &ldquo;that
Mynher Vanderhausen, of Rotterdam, desires to
speak with him to-morrow evening at this hour, and,
if he please, in this room, upon matters of weight;
that is all. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger, having finished this message, turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
abruptly, and, with a quick but silent step quitted
the room before Schalken had time to say a word in
reply.</p>

<p>The young man felt a curiosity to see in what
direction the burgher of Rotterdam would turn on
quitting the studio, and for that purpose he went
directly to the window which commanded the door.</p>

<p>A lobby of considerable extent intervened between
the inner door of the painter&rsquo;s room and the street
entrance, so that Schalken occupied the post of
observation before the old man could possibly have
reached the street.</p>

<p>He watched in vain, however. There was no other
mode of exit.</p>

<p>Had the old man vanished, or was he lurking about
the recesses of the lobby for some bad purpose?
This last suggestion filled the mind of Schalken with
a vague horror, which was so unaccountably intense
as to make him alike afraid to remain in the room
alone and reluctant to pass through the lobby.</p>

<p>However, with an effort which appeared very disproportioned
to the occasion, he summoned resolution
to leave the room, and, having double-locked the
door, and thrust the key in his pocket, without
looking to the right or left, he traversed the passage
which had so recently, perhaps still, contained the
person of his mysterious visitant, scarcely venturing
to breathe till he had arrived in the open street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mynher Vanderhausen,&rdquo; said Gerard Douw, within
himself, as the appointed hour approached; &ldquo;Mynher
Vanderhausen, of Rotterdam! I never heard of the
man till yesterday. What can he want of me? A
portrait, perhaps, to be painted; or a younger son or
a poor relation to be apprenticed; or a collection to be
valued; or&mdash;pshaw! there&rsquo;s no one in Rotterdam to
leave me a legacy. Well, whatever the business may
be, we shall soon know it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was now the close of day, and every easel,
except that of Schalken, was deserted. Gerard
Douw was pacing the apartment with the restless
step of impatient expectation, every now and then
humming a passage from a piece of music which he
was himself composing; for, though no great proficient,
he admired the art; sometimes pausing to
glance over the work of one of his absent pupils, but
more frequently placing himself at the window, from
whence he might observe the passengers who threaded
the obscure by-street in which his studio was placed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Said you not, Godfrey,&rdquo; exclaimed Douw, after a
long and fruitless gaze from his post of observation,
and turning to Schalken&mdash;&ldquo;said you not the hour of
appointment was at about seven by the clock of the
Stadhouse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It had just told seven when I first saw him, sir,&rdquo;
answered the student.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hour is close at hand, then,&rdquo; said the master,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
consulting a horologe as large and as round as a
full-grown orange. &ldquo;Mynher Vanderhausen, from
Rotterdam&mdash;is it not so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such was the name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And an elderly man, richly clad?&rdquo; continued
Douw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As well as I might see,&rdquo; replied his pupil. &ldquo;He
could not be young, nor yet very old neither, and his
dress was rich and grave, as might become a citizen
of wealth and consideration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment the sonorous boom of the Stadhouse
clock told, stroke after stroke, the hour of
seven; the eyes of both master and student were
directed to the door; and it was not until the last
peal of the old bell had ceased to vibrate, that Douw
exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, so; we shall have his worship presently&mdash;that
is, if he means to keep his hour; if not, thou
mayst wait for him, Godfrey, if you court the
acquaintance of a capricious burgomaster. As for
me, I think our old Leyden contains a sufficiency
of such commodities, without an importation from
Rotterdam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Schalken laughed, as in duty bound; and, after a
pause of some minutes, Douw suddenly exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if it should all prove a jest, a piece of
mummery got up by Vankarp, or some such worthy!
I wish you had run all risks, and cudgelled the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
burgomaster, stadholder, or whatever else he may
be, soundly. I would wager a dozen of Rhenish,
his worship would have pleaded old acquaintance
before the third application.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here he comes, sir,&rdquo; said Schalken, in a low,
admonitory tone; and instantly, upon turning towards
the door, Gerard Douw observed the same
figure which had, on the day before, so unexpectedly
greeted the vision of his pupil Schalken.</p>

<p>There was something in the air and mien of the
figure which at once satisfied the painter that there
was no mummery in the case, and that he really
stood in the presence of a man of worship; and so,
without hesitation, he doffed his cap, and courteously
saluting the stranger, requested him to be seated.</p>

<p>The visitor waved his hand slightly, as if in
acknowledgment of the courtesy, but remained
standing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have the honour to see Mynher Vanderhausen,
of Rotterdam?&rdquo; said Gerard Douw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; was the laconic reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand your worship desires to speak with
me,&rdquo; continued Douw, &ldquo;and I am here by appointment
to wait your commands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that a man of trust?&rdquo; said Vanderhausen,
turning towards Schalken, who stood at a little
distance behind his master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Gerard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let him take this box and get the nearest
jeweller or goldsmith to value its contents, and let
him return hither with a certificate of the valuation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the same time he placed a small case, about
nine inches square, in the hands of Gerard Douw,
who was as much amazed at its weight as at the
strange abruptness with which it was handed to
him.</p>

<p>In accordance with the wishes of the stranger, he
delivered it into the hands of Schalken, and repeating
<em>his</em> directions, despatched him upon the mission.</p>

<p>Schalken disposed his precious charge securely
beneath the folds of his cloak, and rapidly traversing
two or three narrow streets, he stopped at a corner
house, the lower part of which was then occupied by
the shop of a Jewish goldsmith.</p>

<p>Schalken entered the shop, and calling the little
Hebrew into the obscurity of its back recesses, he
proceeded to lay before him Vanderhausen&rsquo;s packet.</p>

<p>On being examined by the light of a lamp, it
appeared entirely cased with lead, the outer surface
of which was much scraped and soiled, and nearly
white with age. This was with difficulty partially
removed, and disclosed beneath a box of some dark
and singularly hard wood; this, too, was forced, and
after the removal of two or three folds of linen, its
contents proved to be a mass of golden ingots, close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
packed, and, as the Jew declared, of the most perfect
quality.</p>

<p>Every ingot underwent the scrutiny of the little
Jew, who seemed to feel an epicurean delight in
touching and testing these morsels of the glorious
metal; and each one of them was replaced in the
box with the exclamation,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mein Gott</i>, how very perfect! not one grain of
alloy&mdash;beautiful, beautiful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The task was at length finished, and the Jew
certified under his hand that the value of the ingots
submitted to his examination amounted to many
thousand rix-dollars.</p>

<p>With the desired document in his bosom, and the
rich box of gold carefully pressed under his arm, and
concealed by his cloak, he retraced his way, and,
entering the studio, found his master and the stranger
in close conference.</p>

<p>Schalken had no sooner left the room, in order to
execute the commission he had taken in charge,
than Vanderhausen addressed Gerard Douw in the
following terms:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may not tarry with you to-night more than a
few minutes, and so I shall briefly tell you the matter
upon which I come. You visited the town of Rotterdam
some four months ago, and then I saw in the
church of St. Lawrence your niece, Rose Velderkaust.
I desire to marry her, and if I satisfy you as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
fact that I am very wealthy&mdash;more wealthy than
any husband you could dream of for her&mdash;I expect
that you will forward my views to the utmost
of your authority. If you approve my proposal,
you must close with it at once, for I cannot
command time enough to wait for calculations
and delays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerard Douw was, perhaps, as much astonished as
anyone could be by the very unexpected nature of
Mynher Vanderhausen&rsquo;s communication; but he did
not give vent to any unseemly expression of surprise.
In addition to the motives supplied by prudence and
politeness, the painter experienced a kind of chill
and oppressive sensation&mdash;a feeling like that which
is supposed to affect a man who is placed unconsciously
in immediate contact with something to
which he has a natural antipathy&mdash;an undefined
horror and dread&mdash;while standing in the presence of
the eccentric stranger, which made him very unwilling
to say anything that might reasonably prove
offensive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt,&rdquo; said Gerard, after two or three
prefatory hems, &ldquo;that the connection which you
propose would prove alike advantageous and honourable
to my niece; but you must be aware that she
has a will of her own, and may not acquiesce in what
<em>we</em> may design for her advantage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not seek to deceive me, Sir Painter,&rdquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Vanderhausen; &ldquo;you are her guardian&mdash;she is your
ward. She is mine if <em>you</em> like to make her so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man of Rotterdam moved forward a little as
he spoke, and Gerard Douw, he scarce knew why,
inwardly prayed for the speedy return of Schalken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I desire,&rdquo; said the mysterious gentleman, &ldquo;to
place in your hands at once an evidence of my wealth,
and a security for my liberal dealing with your niece.
The lad will return in a minute or two with a sum in
value five times the fortune which she has a right to
expect from a husband. This shall lie in your
hands, together with her dowry, and you may
apply the united sum as suits her interest best; it
shall be all exclusively hers while she lives. Is that
liberal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douw assented, and inwardly thought that fortune
had been extraordinarily kind to his niece. The
stranger, he deemed, must be most wealthy and
generous, and such an offer was not to be despised,
though made by a humorist, and one of no very
prepossessing presence.</p>

<p>Rose had no very high pretensions, for she was
almost without dowry; indeed, altogether so, excepting
so far as the deficiency had been supplied by
the generosity of her uncle. Neither had she any
right to raise any scruples against the match on the
score of birth, for her own origin was by no means
elevated; and as to other objections, Gerard resolved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
and, indeed, by the usages of the time was warranted
in resolving, not to listen to them for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, addressing the stranger, &ldquo;your offer
is most liberal, and whatever hesitation I may feel in
closing with it immediately, arises solely from my
not having the honour of knowing anything of your
family or station. Upon these points you can, of
course, satisfy me without difficulty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to my respectability,&rdquo; said the stranger, drily,
&ldquo;you must take that for granted at present; pester
me with no inquiries; you can discover nothing
more about me than I choose to make known. You
shall have sufficient security for my respectability&mdash;my
word, if you are honourable; if you are sordid,
my gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A testy old gentleman,&rdquo; thought Douw; &ldquo;he
must have his own way. But, all things considered,
I am justified in giving my niece to him. Were she
my own daughter, I would do the like by her. I
will not pledge myself unnecessarily, however.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not pledge yourself unnecessarily,&rdquo; said
Vanderhausen, strangely uttering the very words
which had just floated through the mind of his companion;
&ldquo;but you will do so if it <em>is</em> necessary, I
presume; and I will show you that I consider it indispensable.
If the gold I mean to leave in your
hands satisfies you, and if you desire that my proposal
shall not be at once withdrawn, you must, before I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
leave this room, write your name to this engagement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, he placed a paper in the
hands of Gerard, the contents of which expressed an
engagement entered into by Gerard Douw, to give
to Wilken Vanderhausen, of Rotterdam, in marriage,
Rose Velderkaust, and so forth, within one week of
the date hereof.</p>

<p>While the painter was employed in reading this
covenant, Schalken, as we have stated, entered the
studio, and having delivered the box and the valuation
of the Jew into the hands of the stranger, he was
about to retire, when Vanderhausen called to him to
wait; and, presenting the case and the certificate to
Gerard Douw, he waited in silence until he had satisfied
himself by an inspection of both as to the value
of the pledge left in his hands. At length he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you content?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The painter said &ldquo;he would fain have another day
to consider.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not an hour,&rdquo; said the suitor, coolly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Douw, &ldquo;I am content; it is a
bargain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then sign at once,&rdquo; said Vanderhausen; &ldquo;I am
weary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the same time he produced a small case of
writing materials, and Gerard signed the important
document.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Let this youth witness the covenant,&rdquo; said the
old man; and Godfrey Schalken unconsciously
signed the instrument which bestowed upon another
that hand which he had so long regarded as the
object and reward of all his labours.</p>

<p>The compact being thus completed, the strange
visitor folded up the paper, and stowed it safely in an
inner pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will visit you to-morrow night, at nine of the
clock, at your house, Gerard Douw, and will see the
subject of our contract. Farewell.&rdquo; And so saying,
Wilken Vanderhausen moved stiffly, but rapidly out
of the room.</p>

<p>Schalken, eager to resolve his doubts, had placed
himself by the window in order to watch the street
entrance; but the experiment served only to support
his suspicions, for the old man did not issue from the
door. This was very strange, very odd, very fearful.
He and his master returned together, and talked but
little on the way, for each had his own subjects of
reflection, of anxiety, and of hope.</p>

<p>Schalken, however, did not know the ruin which
threatened his cherished schemes.</p>

<p>Gerard Douw knew nothing of the attachment
which had sprung up between his pupil and his
niece; and even if he had, it is doubtful whether he
would have regarded its existence as any serious
obstruction to the wishes of Mynher Vanderhausen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Marriages were then and there matters of traffic
and calculation; and it would have appeared as
absurd in the eyes of the guardian to make a mutual
attachment an essential element in a contract of
marriage, as it would have been to draw up his bonds
and receipts in the language of chivalrous romance.</p>

<p>The painter, however, did not communicate to his
niece the important step which he had taken in her
behalf, and his resolution arose not from any anticipation
of opposition on her part, but solely from a
ludicrous consciousness that if his ward were, as she
very naturally might do, to ask him to describe the
appearance of the bridegroom whom he destined for
her, he would be forced to confess that he had not
seen his face, and, if called upon, would find it impossible
to identify him.</p>

<p>Upon the next day, Gerard Douw having dined,
called his niece to him, and having scanned her
person with an air of satisfaction, he took her hand,
and looking upon her pretty, innocent face with a
smile of kindness, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rose, my girl, that face of yours will make your
fortune.&rdquo; Rose blushed and smiled. &ldquo;Such faces
and such tempers seldom go together, and, when they
do, the compound is a love-potion which few heads
or hearts can resist. Trust me, thou wilt soon be a
bride, girl. But this is trifling, and I am pressed for
time, so make ready the large room by eight o&rsquo;clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
to-night, and give directions for supper at nine. I
expect a friend to-night; and observe me, child, do
thou trick thyself out handsomely. I would not have
him think us poor or sluttish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these words he left the chamber, and took
his way to the room to which we have already had
occasion to introduce our readers&mdash;that in which his
pupils worked.</p>

<p>When the evening closed in, Gerard called Schalken,
who was about to take his departure to his
obscure and comfortless lodgings, and asked him
to come home and sup with Rose and Vanderhausen.</p>

<p>The invitation was of course accepted, and Gerard
Douw and his pupil soon found themselves in the
handsome and somewhat antique-looking room which
had been prepared for the reception of the stranger.</p>

<p>A cheerful wood-fire blazed in the capacious
hearth; a little at one side an old-fashioned table,
with richly-carved legs, was placed&mdash;destined, no
doubt, to receive the supper, for which preparations
were going forward; and ranged with exact regularity
stood the tall-backed chairs whose ungracefulness
was more than counterbalanced by their comfort.</p>

<p>The little party, consisting of Rose, her uncle, and
the artist, awaited the arrival of the expected visitor
with considerable impatience.</p>

<p>Nine o&rsquo;clock at length came, and with it a summons
at the street-door, which, being speedily answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
was followed by a slow and emphatic tread upon the
staircase; the steps moved heavily across the lobby,
the door of the room in which the party which we
have described were assembled slowly opened, and
there entered a figure which startled, almost appalled,
the phlegmatic Dutchmen, and nearly made Rose
scream with affright; it was the form, and arrayed
in the garb, of Mynher Vanderhausen; the air, the
gait, the height was the same, but the features had
never been seen by any of the party before.</p>

<p>The stranger stopped at the door of the room, and
displayed his form and face completely. He wore a
dark-coloured cloth cloak, which was short and full,
not falling quite to the knees; his legs were cased in
dark purple silk stockings, and his shoes were adorned
with roses of the same colour. The opening of the
cloak in front showed the under-suit to consist of
some very dark, perhaps sable material, and his
hands were enclosed in a pair of heavy leather gloves
which ran up considerably above the wrist, in the
manner of a gauntlet. In one hand he carried his
walking-stick and his hat, which he had removed, and
the other hung heavily by his side. A quantity of
grizzled hair descended in long tresses from his head,
and its folds rested upon the plaits of a stiff ruff,
which effectually concealed his neck.</p>

<p>So far all was well; but the face!&mdash;all the flesh
of the face was coloured with the bluish leaden hue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
which is sometimes produced by the operation of
metallic medicines administered in excessive quantities;
the eyes were enormous, and the white appeared
both above and below the iris, which gave to them
an expression of insanity, which was heightened by
their glassy fixedness; the nose was well enough, but
the mouth was writhed considerably to one side,
where it opened in order to give egress to two long,
discoloured fangs, which projected from the upper
jaw, far below the lower lip; the hue of the lips themselves
bore the usual relation to that of the face, and
was consequently nearly black. The character of
the face was malignant, even satanic, to the last
degree; and, indeed, such a combination of horror
could hardly be accounted for, except by supposing
the corpse of some atrocious malefactor, which had
long hung blackening upon the gibbet, to have at
length become the habitation of a demon&mdash;the frightful
sport of satanic possession.</p>

<p>It was remarkable that the worshipful stranger
suffered as little as possible of his flesh to appear, and
that during his visit he did not once remove his gloves.</p>

<p>Having stood for some moments at the door,
Gerard Douw at length found breath and collectedness
to bid him welcome, and, with a mute inclination
of the head, the stranger stepped forward
into the room.</p>

<p>There was something indescribably odd, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
horrible about all his motions, something undefinable,
something unnatural, unhuman&mdash;it was as if the limbs
were guided and directed by a spirit unused to the
management of bodily machinery.</p>

<p>The stranger said hardly anything during his visit,
which did not exceed half an hour; and the host
himself could scarcely muster courage enough to
utter the few necessary salutations and courtesies:
and, indeed, such was the nervous terror which the
presence of Vanderhausen inspired, that very little
would have made all his entertainers fly bellowing
from the room.</p>

<p>They had not so far lost all self-possession, however,
as to fail to observe two strange peculiarities of
their visitor.</p>

<p>During his stay he did not once suffer his eyelids
to close, nor even to move in the slightest degree;
and further, there was a death-like stillness in his
whole person, owing to the total absence of the
heaving motion of the chest caused by the process
of respiration.</p>

<p>These two peculiarities, though when told they
may appear trifling, produced a very striking and
unpleasant effect when seen and observed. Vanderhausen
at length relieved the painter of Leyden of
his inauspicious presence; and with no small
gratification the little party heard the street door
close after him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear uncle,&rdquo; said Rose, &ldquo;what a frightful man!
I would not see him again for the wealth of the
States!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tush, foolish girl!&rdquo; said Douw, whose sensations
were anything but comfortable. &ldquo;A man may be as
ugly as the devil, and yet if his heart and actions are
good, he is worth all the pretty-faced, perfumed
puppies that walk the Mall. Rose, my girl, it is
very true he has not thy pretty face, but I know him
to be wealthy and liberal; and were he ten times
more ugly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which is inconceivable,&rdquo; observed Rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These two virtues would be sufficient,&rdquo; continued
her uncle, &ldquo;to counterbalance all his deformity; and
if not of power sufficient actually to alter the shape
of the features, at least of efficacy enough to prevent
one thinking them amiss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know, uncle,&rdquo; said Rose, &ldquo;when I saw
him standing at the door, I could not get it out of
my head that I saw the old, painted, wooden figure
that used to frighten me so much in the church of
St. Laurence at Rotterdam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerard laughed, though he could not help inwardly
acknowledging the justness of the comparison. He
was resolved, however, as far as he could, to check
his niece&rsquo;s inclination to ridicule the ugliness of her
intended bridegroom, although he was not a little
pleased to observe that she appeared totally exempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
from that mysterious dread of the stranger, which, he
could not disguise it from himself, considerably
affected him, as it also did his pupil Godfrey Schalken.</p>

<p>Early on the next day there arrived from various
quarters of the town, rich presents of silks, velvets,
jewellery, and so forth, for Rose; and also a packet
directed to Gerard Douw, which, on being opened,
was found to contain a contract of marriage, formally
drawn up, between Wilken Vanderhausen of the
Boom-quay, in Rotterdam, and Rose Velderkaust of
Leyden, niece to Gerard Douw, master in the art of
painting, also of the same city; and containing
engagements on the part of Vanderhausen to make
settlements upon his bride far more splendid than he
had before led her guardian to believe likely, and
which were to be secured to her use in the most
unexceptionable manner possible&mdash;the money being
placed in the hands of Gerard Douw himself.</p>

<p>I have no sentimental scenes to describe, no cruelty
of guardians or magnanimity of wards, or agonies of
lovers. The record I have to make is one of
sordidness, levity, and interest. In less than a week
after the first interview which we have just described,
the contract of marriage was fulfilled, and Schalken
saw the prize which he would have risked anything
to secure, carried off triumphantly by his formidable
rival.</p>

<p>For two or three days he absented himself from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the school; he then returned and worked, if with less
cheerfulness, with far more dogged resolution than
before; the dream of love had given place to that of
ambition.</p>

<p>Months passed away, and, contrary to his expectation,
and, indeed, to the direct promise of the
parties, Gerard Douw heard nothing of his niece or
her worshipful spouse. The interest of the money,
which was to have been demanded in quarterly sums,
lay unclaimed in his hands. He began to grow
extremely uneasy.</p>

<p>Mynher Vanderhausen&rsquo;s direction in Rotterdam
he was fully possessed of. After some irresolution
he finally determined to journey thither&mdash;a trifling
undertaking, and easily accomplished&mdash;and thus to
satisfy himself of the safety and comfort of his ward,
for whom he entertained an honest and strong
affection.</p>

<p>His search was in vain, however. No one in
Rotterdam had ever heard of Mynher Vanderhausen.</p>

<p>Gerard Douw left not a house in the Boom-quay
untried; but all in vain. No one could give him
any information whatever touching the object of his
inquiry; and he was obliged to return to Leyden,
nothing wiser than when he had left it.</p>

<p>On his arrival he hastened to the establishment
from which Vanderhausen had hired the lumbering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
though, considering the times, most luxurious
vehicle which the bridal party had employed to
convey them to Rotterdam. From the driver of this
machine he learned, that having proceeded by slow
stages, they had late in the evening approached
Rotterdam; but that before they entered the city,
and while yet nearly a mile from it, a small party of
men, soberly clad, and after the old fashion, with
peaked beards and moustaches, standing in the
centre of the road, obstructed the further progress
of the carriage. The driver reined in his horses,
much fearing, from the obscurity of the hour, and
the loneliness of the road, that some mischief was
intended.</p>

<p>His fears were, however, somewhat allayed by his
observing that these strange men carried a large
litter, of an antique shape, and which they immediately
set down upon the pavement, whereupon
the bridegroom, having opened the coach-door from
within, descended, and having assisted his bride to
do likewise, led her, weeping bitterly and wringing
her hands, to the litter, which they both entered.
It was then raised by the men who surrounded it,
and speedily carried towards the city, and before it
had proceeded many yards the darkness concealed
it from the view of the Dutch chariot.</p>

<p>In the inside of the vehicle he found a purse,
whose contents more than thrice paid the hire of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
carriage and man. He saw and could tell nothing
more of Mynher Vanderhausen and his beautiful
lady. This mystery was a source of deep anxiety
and almost of grief to Gerard Douw.</p>

<p>There was evidently fraud in the dealing of Vanderhausen
with him, though for what purpose committed
he could not imagine. He greatly doubted how far
it was possible for a man possessing in his
countenance so strong an evidence of the presence of
the most demoniac feelings to be in reality anything
but a villain; and every day that passed without
his hearing from or of his niece, instead of
inducing him to forget his fears, tended more and
more to intensify them.</p>

<p>The loss of his niece&rsquo;s cheerful society tended also
to depress his spirits; and in order to dispel this
despondency, which often crept upon his mind after
his daily employment was over, he was wont
frequently to prevail upon Schalken to accompany
him home, and by his presence to dispel, in some
degree, the gloom of his otherwise solitary supper.</p>

<p>One evening, the painter and his pupil were
sitting by the fire, having accomplished a comfortable
supper. They had yielded to that silent pensiveness
sometimes induced by the process of digestion, when
their reflections were disturbed by a loud sound at
the street-door, as if occasioned by some person
rushing forcibly and repeatedly against it. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
domestic had run without delay to ascertain the
cause of the disturbance, and they heard him twice or
thrice interrogate the applicant for admission, but
without producing an answer or any cessation of the
sounds.</p>

<p>They heard him then open the hall door, and
immediately there followed a light and rapid tread
upon the staircase. Schalken laid his hand on his
sword, and advanced towards the door. It opened
before he reached it, and Rose rushed into the room.
She looked wild and haggard, and pale with
exhaustion and terror; but her dress surprised them
as much even as her unexpected appearance. It
consisted of a kind of white woollen wrapper, made
close about the neck, and descending to the very
ground. It was much deranged and travel-soiled.
The poor creature had hardly entered the chamber
when she fell senseless on the floor. With some
difficulty they succeeded in reviving her, and on
recovering her senses she instantly exclaimed, in a
tone of eager, terrified impatience,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wine, wine, quickly, or I&rsquo;m lost!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Much alarmed at the strange agitation in which
the call was made, they at once administered to her
wishes, and she drank some wine with a haste and
eagerness which surprised him. She had hardly
swallowed it, when she exclaimed with the same
urgency,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Food, food, at once, or I perish!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A considerable fragment of a roast joint was upon
the table, and Schalken immediately proceeded to
cut some, but he was anticipated; for no sooner had
she become aware of its presence than she darted at
it with the rapacity of a vulture, and, seizing it in
her hands, she tore off the flesh with her teeth and
swallowed it.</p>

<p>When the paroxysm of hunger had been a little
appeased, she appeared suddenly to become aware
how strange her conduct had been, or it may have
been that other more agitating thoughts recurred to
her mind, for she began to weep bitterly, and to wring
her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! send for a minister of God,&rdquo; said she;
&ldquo;I am not safe till he comes; send for him
speedily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerard Douw despatched a messenger instantly,
and prevailed on his niece to allow him to surrender
his bedchamber to her use; he also persuaded her to
retire to it at once and to rest; her consent was
extorted upon the condition that they would not
leave her for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh that the holy man were here!&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;he can deliver me. The dead and the living can
never be one&mdash;God has forbidden it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these mysterious words she surrendered
herself to their guidance, and they proceeded to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
chamber which Gerard Douw had assigned to her
use.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not&mdash;do not leave me for a moment,&rdquo; said
she. &ldquo;I am lost for ever if you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerard Douw&rsquo;s chamber was approached through
a spacious apartment, which they were now about to
enter. Gerard Douw and Schalken each carried a
wax candle, so that a sufficient degree of light was
cast upon all surrounding objects. They were now
entering the large chamber, which, as I have said,
communicated with Douw&rsquo;s apartment, when Rose
suddenly stopped, and, in a whisper which seemed
to thrill with horror, she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O God! he is here&mdash;he is here! See, see&mdash;there
he goes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She pointed towards the door of the inner room,
and Schalken thought he saw a shadowy and ill-defined
form gliding into that apartment. He drew
his sword, and raising the candle so as to throw its
light with increased distinctness upon the objects in
the room, he entered the chamber into which the
figure had glided. No figure was there&mdash;nothing
but the furniture which belonged to the room, and
yet he could not be deceived as to the fact that
something had moved before them into the chamber.</p>

<p>A sickening dread came upon him, and the cold
perspiration broke out in heavy drops upon his
forehead; nor was he more composed when he heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the increased urgency, the agony of entreaty, with
which Rose implored them not to leave her for a
moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw him,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s here! I cannot be
deceived&mdash;I know him. He&rsquo;s by me&mdash;he&rsquo;s with me&mdash;he&rsquo;s
in the room. Then, for God&rsquo;s sake, as you
would save, do not stir from beside me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They at length prevailed upon her to lie down
upon the bed, where she continued to urge them to
stay by her. She frequently uttered incoherent
sentences, repeating again and again, &ldquo;The dead and
the living cannot be one&mdash;God has forbidden it!&rdquo;
and then again, &ldquo;Rest to the wakeful&mdash;sleep to the
sleep-walkers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These and such mysterious and broken sentences
she continued to utter until the clergyman arrived.</p>

<p>Gerard Douw began to fear, naturally enough, that
the poor girl, owing to terror or ill-treatment, had
become deranged; and he half suspected, by the
suddenness of her appearance, and the unseasonableness
of the hour, and, above all, from the wildness
and terror of her manner, that she had made her
escape from some place of confinement for lunatics,
and was in immediate fear of pursuit. He resolved
to summon medical advice as soon as the mind of his
niece had been in some measure set at rest by the
offices of the clergyman whose attendance she had
so earnestly desired; and until this object had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
attained, he did not venture to put any questions to
her, which might possibly, by reviving painful or
horrible recollections, increase her agitation.</p>

<p>The clergyman soon arrived&mdash;a man of ascetic
countenance and venerable age&mdash;one whom Gerard
Douw respected much, forasmuch as he was a veteran
polemic, though one, perhaps, more dreaded as a
combatant than beloved as a Christian&mdash;of pure
morality, subtle brain, and frozen heart. He entered
the chamber which communicated with that in which
Rose reclined, and immediately on his arrival she
requested him to pray for her, as for one who lay in
the hands of Satan, and who could hope for deliverance
only from Heaven.</p>

<p>That our readers may distinctly understand all the
circumstances of the event which we are about imperfectly
to describe, it is necessary to state the
relative positions of the parties who were engaged in
it. The old clergyman and Schalken were in the
ante-room of which we have already spoken; Rose
lay in the inner chamber, the door of which was
open; and by the side of the bed, at her urgent
desire, stood her guardian; a candle burned in the
bedchamber, and three were lighted in the outer
apartment.</p>

<p>The old man now cleared his voice, as if about to
commence; but before he had time to begin, a sudden
gust of air blew out the candle which served to illuminate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the room in which the poor girl lay, and she
with hurried alarm, exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Godfrey, bring in another candle; the darkness is
unsafe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerard Douw, forgetting for the moment her repeated
injunctions in the immediate impulse, stepped
from the bedchamber into the other, in order to
supply what she desired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O God! do not go, dear uncle!&rdquo; shrieked the
unhappy girl; and at the same time she sprang from
the bed and darted after him, in order, by her grasp,
to detain him.</p>

<p>But the warning came too late, for scarcely had he
passed the threshold, and hardly had his niece had
time to utter the startling exclamation, when the
door which divided the two rooms closed violently
after him, as if swung to by a strong blast of wind.</p>

<p>Schalken and he both rushed to the door, but their
united and desperate efforts could not avail so much
as to shake it.</p>

<p>Shriek after shriek burst from the inner chamber,
with all the piercing loudness of despairing terror.
Schalken and Douw applied every energy and
strained every nerve to force open the door; but all
in vain.</p>

<p>There was no sound of struggling from within, but
the screams seemed to increase in loudness, and at
the same time they heard the bolts of the latticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
window withdrawn, and the window itself grated upon
the sill as if thrown open.</p>

<p>One last shriek, so long and piercing and agonized
as to be scarcely human, swelled from the room, and
suddenly there followed a death-like silence.</p>

<p>A light step was heard crossing the floor, as if from
the bed to the window; and almost at the same
instant the door gave way, and yielding to the
pressure of the external applicants, they were nearly
precipitated into the room. It was empty. The
window was open, and Schalken sprang to a chair and
gazed out upon the street and at the canal below. He
saw no form, but he beheld, or thought he beheld, the
waters of the broad canal beneath settling ring after
ring in heavy circular ripples, as if a moment before
disturbed by the immersion of some large and heavy
mass.</p>

<p>No trace of Rose was ever after discovered, nor
was anything certain respecting her mysterious wooer
detected or even suspected; no clue whereby to trace
the intricacies of the labyrinth, and to arrive at a
distinct conclusion was to be found. But an incident
occurred, which, though it will not be received by our
rational readers as at all approaching to evidence
upon the matter, nevertheless produced a strong and
a lasting impression upon the mind of Schalken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter1">

<br /><span class="caption">THE WATERS OF THE BROAD CANAL BENEATH SETTLING RING
AFTER RING IN HEAVY CIRCULAR RIPPLES.</span>
</div>

<p>Many years after the events which we have detailed,
Schalken, then remotely situated, received an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
intimation of his father&rsquo;s death, and of his intended
burial upon a fixed day in the church of Rotterdam.
It was necessary that a very considerable journey
should be performed by the funeral procession, which,
as it will readily be believed, was not very numerously
attended. Schalken with difficulty arrived in Rotterdam
late in the day upon which the funeral was
appointed to take place. The procession had not
then arrived. Evening closed in, and still it did not
appear.</p>

<p>Schalken strolled down to the church&mdash;he found it
open; notice of the arrival of the funeral had been
given, and the vault in which the body was to be laid
had been opened. The official who corresponds to
our sexton, on seeing a well-dressed gentleman, whose
object was to attend the expected funeral, pacing the
aisle of the church, hospitably invited him to share
with him the comforts of a blazing wood fire, which
as was his custom in winter time upon such occasions,
he had kindled on the hearth of a chamber which
communicated by a flight of steps with the vault
below.</p>

<p>In this chamber Schalken and his entertainer
seated themselves; and the sexton, after some fruitless
attempts to engage his guest in conversation,
was obliged to apply himself to his tobacco-pipe and
can to solace his solitude.</p>

<p>In spite of his grief and cares, the fatigues of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
rapid journey of nearly forty hours gradually overcame
the mind and body of Godfrey Schalken, and
he sank into a deep sleep, from which he was
awakened by some one shaking him gently by the
shoulder. He first thought that the old sexton had
called him, but <em>he</em> was no longer in the room.</p>

<p>He roused himself, and as soon as he could clearly
see what was around him, he perceived a female form,
clothed in a kind of light robe of muslin, part of
which was so disposed as to act as a veil, and in her
hand she carried a lamp. She was moving rather
away from him, and towards the flight of steps which
conducted towards the vaults.</p>

<p>Schalken felt a vague alarm at the sight of this
figure, and at the same time an irresistible impulse
to follow its guidance. He followed it towards the
vaults, but when it reached the head of the stairs, he
paused; the figure paused also, and turning gently
round, displayed, by the light of the lamp it carried,
the face and features of his first love, Rose Velderkaust.
There was nothing horrible, or even sad, in
the countenance. On the contrary, it wore the same
arch smile which used to enchant the artist long
before in his happy days.</p>

<p>A feeling of awe and of interest, too intense to be
resisted, prompted him to follow the spectre, if spectre
it were. She descended the stairs&mdash;he followed;
and, turning to the left, through a narrow passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
she led him, to his infinite surprise, into what
appeared to be an old-fashioned Dutch apartment,
such as the pictures of Gerard Douw have served to
immortalize.</p>

<p>Abundance of costly antique furniture was disposed
about the room, and in one corner stood a four-post
bed, with heavy black cloth curtains around it. The
figure frequently turned towards him with the same
arch smile; and when she came to the side of the
bed, she drew the curtains, and by the light of the
lamp which she held towards its contents, she disclosed
to the horror-stricken painter, sitting bolt
upright in the bed, the livid and demoniac form of
Vanderhausen. Schalken had hardly seen him when
he fell senseless upon the floor, where he lay until
discovered, on the next morning, by persons employed
in closing the passages into the vaults. He
was lying in a cell of considerable size, which had
not been disturbed for a long time, and he had fallen
beside a large coffin which was supported upon small
stone pillars, a security against the attacks of vermin.</p>

<p>To his dying day Schalken was satisfied of the
reality of the vision which he had witnessed, and he
has left behind him a curious evidence of the impression
which it wrought upon his fancy, in a painting
executed shortly after the event we have narrated,
and which is valuable as exhibiting not only the
peculiarities which have made Schalken&rsquo;s pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
sought after, but even more so as presenting a portrait,
as close and faithful as one taken from memory
can be, of his early
love, Rose Velderkaust,
whose mysterious fate
must ever remain matter
of speculation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill08.jpg" width="368" height="461" alt="" title="" />
<br /><span class="caption">SHE DREW THE CURTAINS.</span>
</div>

<p>The picture represents a chamber of antique
masonry, such as might be found in most old cathedrals,
and is lighted faintly by a lamp carried in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
hand of a female figure, such as we have above
attempted to describe; and in the background, and
to the left of him who examines the painting, there
stands the form of a man apparently aroused from
sleep, and by his attitude, his hand being laid upon
his sword, exhibiting considerable alarm; this last
figure is illuminated only by the expiring glare of a
wood or charcoal fire.</p>

<p>The whole production exhibits a beautiful specimen
of that artful and singular distribution of light and
shade which has rendered the name of Schalken
immortal among the artists of his country. This
tale is traditionary, and the reader will easily perceive,
by our studiously omitting to heighten many points
of the narrative, when a little additional colouring
might have added effect to the recital, that we have
desired to lay before him, not a figment of the brain,
but a curious tradition connected with, and belonging
to, the biography of a famous artist.</p>

<p>In the south of Ireland, and on the borders of the
county of Limerick, there lies a district of two or
three miles in length, which is rendered interesting
by the fact that it is one of the very few spots
throughout this country in which some vestiges of
aboriginal forests still remain. It has little or none
of the lordly character of the American forest, for the
axe has felled its oldest and its grandest trees; but
in the close wood which survives live all the wild and
pleasing peculiarities of nature: its complete irregularity,
its vistas, in whose perspective the quiet cattle
are browsing; its refreshing glades, where the grey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
rocks arise from amid the nodding fern; the silvery
shafts of the old birch-trees; the knotted trunks of
the hoary oak, the grotesque but graceful branches
which never shed their honours under the tyrant
pruning-hook; the soft green sward; the chequered
light and shade; the wild luxuriant weeds; the lichen
and the moss&mdash;all are beautiful alike in the green
freshness of spring or in the sadness and sere of
autumn. Their beauty is of that kind which makes
the heart full with joy&mdash;appealing to the affections
with a power which belongs to nature only. This
wood runs up, from below the base, to the ridge of a
long line of irregular hills, having perhaps, in primitive
times, formed but the skirting of some mighty
forest which occupied the level below.</p>

<p>But now, alas! whither have we drifted? whither
has the tide of civilization borne us? It has passed
over a land unprepared for it&mdash;it has left nakedness
behind it; we have lost our forests, but our marauders
remain; we have destroyed all that is picturesque,
while we have retained everything that is revolting in
barbarism. Through the midst of this woodland
there runs a deep gully or glen, where the stillness of
the scene is broken in upon by the brawling of a
mountain-stream, which, however, in the winter
season, swells into a rapid and formidable torrent.</p>

<p>There is one point at which the glen becomes
extremely deep and narrow; the sides descend to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
depth of some hundred feet, and are so steep as to
be nearly perpendicular. The wild trees which have
taken root in the crannies and chasms of the rock
are so intersected and entangled, that one can with
difficulty catch a glimpse of the stream which wheels,
flashes, and foams below, as if exulting in the surrounding
silence and solitude.</p>

<p>This spot was not unwisely chosen, as a point of no
ordinary strength, for the erection of a massive square
tower or keep, one side of which rises as if in continuation
of the precipitous cliff on which it is based.
Originally, the only mode of ingress was by a narrow
portal in the very wall which overtopped the precipice,
opening upon a ledge of rock which afforded a precarious
pathway, cautiously intersected, however, by
a deep trench cut out with great labour in the living
rock; so that, in its pristine state, and before the
introduction of artillery into the art of war, this tower
might have been pronounced, and that not presumptuously,
impregnable.</p>

<p>The progress of improvement and the increasing
security of the times had, however, tempted its successive
proprietors, if not to adorn, at least to enlarge
their premises, and about the middle of the last century,
when the castle was last inhabited, the original
square tower formed but a small part of the edifice.</p>

<p>The castle, and a wide tract of the surrounding
country, had from time immemorial belonged to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
family which, for distinctness, we shall call by the
name of Ardagh; and owing to the associations
which, in Ireland, almost always attach to scenes
which have long witnessed alike the exercise of stern
feudal authority, and of that savage hospitality which
distinguished the good old times, this building has become
the subject and the scene of many wild and extraordinary
traditions. One of them I have been enabled,
by a personal acquaintance with an eye-witness of the
events, to trace to its origin; and yet it is hard to say
whether the events which I am about to record appear
more strange and improbable as seen through
the distorting medium of tradition, or in the appalling
dimness of uncertainty which surrounds the reality.</p>

<p>Tradition says that, sometime in the last century,
Sir Robert Ardagh, a young man, and the last heir
of that family, went abroad and served in foreign
armies; and that, having acquired considerable honour
and emolument, he settled at Castle Ardagh, the
building we have just now attempted to describe.
He was what the country people call a <em>dark</em> man;
that is, he was considered morose, reserved, and ill-tempered;
and, as it was supposed from the utter
solitude of his life, was upon no terms of cordiality
with the other members of his family.</p>

<p>The only occasion upon which he broke through
the solitary monotony of his life was during the continuance
of the racing season, and immediately subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
to it; at which time he was to be seen among
the busiest upon the course, betting deeply and unhesitatingly,
and invariably with success. Sir Robert
was, however, too well known as a man of honour,
and of too high a family, to be suspected of any
unfair dealing. He was, moreover, a soldier, and a
man of intrepid as well as of a haughty character;
and no one cared to hazard a surmise, the consequences
of which would be felt most probably by its
originator only.</p>

<p>Gossip, however, was not silent; it was remarked
that Sir Robert never appeared at the race-ground,
which was the only place of public resort which he
frequented, except in company with a certain strange-looking
person, who was never seen elsewhere, or
under other circumstances. It was remarked, too,
that this man, whose relation to Sir Robert was never
distinctly ascertained, was the only person to whom
he seemed to speak unnecessarily; it was observed
that while with the country gentry he exchanged no
further communication than what was unavoidable in
arranging his sporting transactions, with this person
he would converse earnestly and frequently. Tradition
asserts that, to enhance the curiosity which this
unaccountable and exclusive preference excited, the
stranger possessed some striking and unpleasant peculiarities
of person and of garb&mdash;though it is not stated,
however, what these were&mdash;but they, in conjunction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
with Sir Robert&rsquo;s secluded habits and extraordinary
run of luck&mdash;a success which was supposed to result
from the suggestions and immediate advice of the
unknown&mdash;were sufficient to warrant report in pronouncing
that there was something <em>queer</em> in the wind,
and in surmising that Sir Robert was playing a
fearful and a hazardous game, and that, in short, his
strange companion was little better than the Devil
himself.</p>

<p>Years rolled quietly away, and nothing very
novel occurred in the arrangements of Castle Ardagh,
excepting that Sir Robert parted with his odd companion,
but as nobody could tell whence he came,
so nobody could say whither he had gone. Sir
Robert&rsquo;s habits, however, underwent no consequent
change; he continued regularly to frequent the
race meetings, without mixing at all in the convivialities
of the gentry, and immediately afterwards
to relapse into the secluded monotony of his ordinary
life.</p>

<p>It was said that he had accumulated vast sums of
money&mdash;and, as his bets were always successful
and always large, such must have been the case. He
did not suffer the acquisition of wealth, however, to
influence his hospitality or his house-keeping&mdash;he
neither purchased land, nor extended his establishment;
and his mode of enjoying his money must
have been altogether that of the miser&mdash;consisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
merely in the pleasure of touching and telling his
gold, and in the consciousness of wealth.</p>

<p>Sir Robert&rsquo;s temper, so far from improving, became
more than ever gloomy and morose. He sometimes
carried the indulgence of his evil dispositions to such
a height that it bordered upon insanity. During
these paroxysms he would neither eat, drink, nor sleep.
On such occasions he insisted on perfect privacy,
even from the intrusion of his most trusted servants;
his voice was frequently heard, sometimes in earnest
supplication, sometimes raised, as if in loud and
angry altercation with some unknown visitant. Sometimes
he would for hours together walk to and fro
throughout the long oak-wainscoted apartment which
he generally occupied, with wild gesticulations and
agitated pace, in the manner of one who has been
roused to a state of unnatural excitement by some
sudden and appalling intimation.</p>

<p>These paroxysms of apparent lunacy were so
frightful, that during their continuance even his oldest
and most faithful domestics dared not approach him;
consequently his hours of agony were never intruded
upon, and the mysterious causes of his sufferings
appeared likely to remain hidden for ever.</p>

<p>On one occasion a fit of this kind continued for an
unusual time; the ordinary term of their duration&mdash;about
two days&mdash;had been long past, and the old
servant who generally waited upon Sir Robert after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
these visitations, having in vain listened for the well-known
tinkle of his master&rsquo;s hand-bell, began to feel
extremely anxious; he feared that his master might
have died from sheer exhaustion, or perhaps put an
end to his own existence during his miserable depression.
These fears at length became so strong,
that having in vain urged some of his brother servants
to accompany him, he determined to go up alone,
and himself see whether any accident had befallen
Sir Robert.</p>

<p>He traversed the several passages which conducted
from the new to the more ancient parts of the
mansion, and having arrived in the old hall of the
castle, the utter silence of the hour&mdash;for it was very
late in the night&mdash;the idea of the nature of the enterprise
in which he was engaging himself, a sensation
of remoteness from anything like human companionship,
but, more than all, the vivid but undefined
anticipation of something horrible, came upon him
with such oppressive weight that he hesitated as to
whether he should proceed. Real uneasiness, however,
respecting the fate of his master, for whom he
felt that kind of attachment which the force of
habitual intercourse not unfrequently engenders respecting
objects not in themselves amiable, and also
a latent unwillingness to expose his weakness to the
ridicule of his fellow-servants, combined to overcome
his reluctance; and he had just placed his foot upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the first step of the staircase which conducted to his
master&rsquo;s chamber, when his attention was arrested
by a low but distinct knocking at the hall-door.
Not, perhaps, very sorry at finding thus an excuse
even for deferring his intended expedition, he placed
the candle upon a stone block which lay in the hall
and approached the door, uncertain whether his ears
had not deceived him. This doubt was justified by
the circumstance that the hall entrance had been for
nearly fifty years disused as a mode of ingress to
the castle. The situation of this gate also, which we
have endeavoured to describe, opening upon a narrow
ledge of rock which overhangs a perilous cliff,
rendered it at all times, but particularly at night, a
dangerous entrance. This shelving platform of rock,
which formed the only avenue to the door, was
divided, as I have already stated, by a broad chasm,
the planks across which had long disappeared, by
decay or otherwise; so that it seemed at least highly
improbable that any man could have found his way
across the passage in safety to the door, more particularly
on a night like this, of singular darkness.
The old man, therefore, listened attentively, to ascertain
whether the first application should be followed
by another. He had not long to wait. The same
low but singularly distinct knocking was repeated;
so low that it seemed as if the applicant had employed
no harder or heavier instrument than his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
hand, and yet, despite the immense thickness of the
door, with such strength that the sound was distinctly
audible.</p>

<p>The knock was repeated a third time, without any
increase of loudness; and the old man, obeying an
impulse for which to his dying hour he could never
account, proceeded to remove, one by one, the three
great oaken bars which secured the door. Time and
damp had effectually corroded the iron chambers of
the lock, so that it afforded little resistance. With
some effort, as he believed, assisted from without,
the old servant succeeded in opening the door; and
a low, square-built figure, apparently that of a man
wrapped in a large black cloak, entered the hall.
The servant could not see much of this visitor with
any distinctness; his dress appeared foreign, the
skirt of his ample cloak was thrown over one
shoulder; he wore a large felt hat, with a very
heavy leaf, from under which escaped what appeared
to be a mass of long sooty-black hair; his feet were
cased in heavy riding-boots. Such were the few
particulars which the servant had time and light
to observe. The stranger desired him to let his
master know instantly that a friend had come,
by appointment, to settle some business with him.
The servant hesitated, but a slight motion on the part
of his visitor, as if to possess himself of the candle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
determined him; so, taking it in his hand, he ascended
the castle stairs, leaving the guest in the hall.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill09.jpg" width="383" height="396"
alt="HE PAUSED, BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND." title="HE PAUSED, BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND." />
</div>

<p>On reaching the apartment which opened upon
the oak-chamber he was surprised to observe the
door of that room
partly open, and the
room itself lit up. He
paused, but there was
no sound; he looked
in, and saw Sir
Robert, his head and
the upper part of his body
reclining on a table, upon
which two candles burned;
his arms were stretched forward
on either side, and perfectly motionless;
it appeared that, having been sitting at the
table, he had thus sunk forward, either dead or
in a swoon. There was no sound of breathing;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
all was silent, except the sharp ticking of a
watch, which lay beside the lamp. The servant
coughed twice or thrice, but with no effect; his fears
now almost amounted to certainty, and he was
approaching the table on which his master partly
lay, to satisfy himself of his death, when Sir Robert
slowly raised his head, and, throwing himself back
in his chair, fixed his eyes in a ghastly and uncertain
gaze upon his attendant. At length he
said, slowly and painfully, as if he dreaded the
answer,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, what are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the servant, &ldquo;a strange gentleman
wants to see you below.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this intimation Sir Robert, starting to his feet
and tossing his arms wildly upwards, uttered a shriek
of such appalling and despairing terror that it was
almost too fearful for human endurance; and long
after the sound had ceased it seemed to the terrified
imagination of the old servant to roll through the
deserted passages in bursts of unnatural laughter.
After a few moments Sir Robert said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you send him away? Why does he come
so soon? O Merciful Powers! let him leave me for
an hour; a little time. I can&rsquo;t see him now; try to
get him away. You see I can&rsquo;t go down now; I
have not strength. O God! O God! let him come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
back in an hour; it is not long to wait. He cannot
lose anything by it; nothing, nothing, nothing. Tell
him that! Say anything to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servant went down. In his own words, he
did not feel the stairs under him till he got
to the hall. The figure stood exactly as he had left
it. He delivered his master&rsquo;s message as coherently
as he could. The stranger replied in a careless
tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Sir Robert will not come down to me; I must
go up to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man returned, and to his surprise he found his
master much more composed in manner. He listened
to the message, and though the cold perspiration rose
in drops upon his forehead faster than he could wipe
it away, his manner had lost the dreadful agitation
which had marked it before. He rose feebly, and
casting a last look of agony behind him, passed from
the room to the lobby, where he signed to his attendant
not to follow him. The man moved as far as
the head of the staircase, from whence he had a
tolerably distinct view of the hall, which was imperfectly
lighted by the candle he had left there.</p>

<p>He saw his master reel, rather than walk, down the
stairs, clinging all the way to the banisters. He
walked on, as if about to sink every moment from
weakness. The figure advanced as if to meet him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
and in passing struck down the light. The servant
could see no more; but there was a sound of struggling,
renewed at intervals with silent but fearful
energy. It was evident, however, that the parties
were approaching the door, for he heard the solid
oak sound twice or thrice, as the feet of the combatants,
in shuffling hither and thither over the floor,
struck upon it. After a slight pause, he heard the
door thrown open with such violence that the leaf
seemed to strike the side-wall of the hall, for it was
so dark without that this could only be surmised by
the sound. The struggle was renewed with an agony
and intenseness of energy that betrayed itself in deep-drawn
gasps. One desperate effort, which terminated
in the breaking of some part of the door, producing
a sound as if the door-post was wrenched from its
position, was followed by another wrestle, evidently
upon the narrow ledge which ran outside the door,
overtopping the precipice. This proved to be the
final struggle; it was followed by a crashing sound
as if some heavy body had fallen over, and was rushing
down the precipice through the light boughs
that crossed near the top. All then became still as
the grave, except when the moan of the night-wind
sighed up the wooded glen.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill10.jpg" width="394" height="624"
alt="AT THE FOOT OF THE PRECIPICE." title="AT THE FOOT OF THE PRECIPICE." />
</div>

<p>The old servant had not nerve to return through
the hall, and to him the darkness seemed all but endless;
but morning at length came, and with it the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
disclosure of the events of the night. Near the door,
upon the ground, lay
Sir Robert&rsquo;s sword-belt,
which had given
way in the scuffle. A
huge splinter from
the massive door-post
had been wrenched
off by an almost
superhuman effort&mdash;one
which
nothing but the
gripe of a
despairing
man could have
severed&mdash;and on
the rocks outside
were left the
marks of the slipping
and sliding
of feet.</p>

<p>At the foot of the
precipice, not immediately
under the
castle, but dragged
some way up the glen,
were found the remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of Sir Robert, with hardly a vestige of a limb
or feature left distinguishable. The right hand, however,
was uninjured, and in its fingers were clutched,
with the fixedness of death, a long lock of coarse
sooty hair&mdash;the only direct circumstantial evidence of
the presence of a second person.</p>

</div>

<p>Dreams! What age,
or what country of the
world, has not felt and
acknowledged the mystery of their origin and end?
I have thought not a little upon the subject, seeing
it is one which has been often forced upon my
attention, and sometimes strangely enough; and
yet I have never arrived at anything which at all
appeared a satisfactory conclusion. It does appear
that a mental phenomenon so extraordinary cannot
be wholly without its use. We know, indeed, that in
the olden times it has been made the organ of communication
between the Deity and His creatures;
and when a dream produces upon a mind, to all
appearance hopelessly reprobate and depraved,
an effect so powerful and so lasting as to break
down the inveterate habits, and to reform the
life of an abandoned sinner, we see in the result, in
the reformation of morals which appeared incorrigible,
in the reclamation of a human soul which seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
to be irretrievably lost, something more than could
be produced by a mere chimera of the slumbering
fancy, something more than could arise from the
capricious images of a terrified imagination. And
while Reason rejects as absurd the superstition
which will read a prophecy in every dream, she
may, without violence to herself, recognize, even
in the wildest and most incongruous of the wanderings
of a slumbering intellect, the evidences
and the fragments of a language which may be
spoken, which <em>has</em> been spoken, to terrify, to warn
and to command. We have reason to believe too,
by the promptness of action which in the age of the
prophets followed all intimations of this kind, and by
the strength of conviction and strange permanence of
the effects resulting from certain dreams in latter
times&mdash;which effects we ourselves may have witnessed&mdash;that
when this medium of communication has been
employed by the Deity, the evidences of His presence
have been unequivocal. My thoughts were directed
to this subject in a manner to leave a lasting impression
upon my mind, by the events which I shall now
relate, the statement of which, however extraordinary,
is nevertheless accurate.</p>

<p>About the year 17&mdash;, having been appointed to
the living of C&mdash;&mdash;h, I rented a small house in the
town which bears the same name: one morning in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the month of November, I was awakened before my
usual time by my servant, who bustled into my bedroom
for the purpose of announcing a sick call. As
the Catholic Church holds her last rites to be totally
indispensable to the safety of the departing sinner, no
conscientious clergyman can afford a moment&rsquo;s unnecessary
delay, and in little more than five minutes
I stood ready, cloaked and booted for the road, in the
small front parlour in which the messenger, who was
to act as my guide, awaited my coming. I found a
poor little girl crying piteously near the door, and
after some slight difficulty I ascertained that her
father was either dead or just dying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what may be your father&rsquo;s name, my poor
child?&rdquo; said I. She held down her head as if
ashamed. I repeated the question, and the wretched
little creature burst into floods of tears still more
bitter than she had shed before. At length, almost
angered by conduct which appeared to me so unreasonable,
I began to lose patience, and I said rather
harshly,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will not tell me the name of the person to
whom you would lead me, your silence can arise from
no good motive, and I might be justified in refusing
to go with you at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say that&mdash;don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; cried she.
&ldquo;Oh, sir, it was that I was afeard of when I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
not tell you&mdash;I was afeard, when you heard his name,
you would not come with me; but it is no use hidin&rsquo;
it now&mdash;it&rsquo;s Pat Connell, the carpenter, your
honour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked in my face with the most earnest
anxiety, as if her very existence depended upon
what she should read there. I relieved the child at
once. The name, indeed, was most unpleasantly
familiar to me; but, however fruitless my visits and
advice might have been at another time, the present
was too fearful an occasion to suffer my doubts of
their utility, or my reluctance to re-attempting what
appeared a hopeless task, to weigh even against the
lightest chance that a consciousness of his imminent
danger might produce in him a more docile and
tractable disposition. Accordingly I told the child
to lead the way, and followed her in silence. She
hurried rapidly through the long narrow street which
forms the great thoroughfare of the town. The darkness
of the hour, rendered still deeper by the close
approach of the old-fashioned houses, which lowered
in tall obscurity on either side of the way; the
damp, dreary chill which renders the advance of
morning peculiarly cheerless, combined with the object
of my walk&mdash;to visit the death-bed of a presumptuous
sinner, to endeavour, almost against my own
conviction, to infuse a hope into the heart of a dying
reprobate&mdash;a drunkard but too probably perishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
under the consequences of some mad fit of intoxication;
all these circumstances served to enhance
the gloom and solemnity of my feelings, as I silently
followed my little guide, who with quick steps
traversed the uneven pavement of the Main Street.
After a walk of about five minutes, she turned off
into a narrow lane, of that obscure and comfortless
class which is to be found in almost all small old-fashioned
towns, chill, without ventilation, reeking
with all manner of offensive effluviæ, and lined by
dingy, smoky, sickly and pent-up buildings, frequently
not only in a wretched but in a dangerous
condition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father has changed his abode since I last
visited him, and, I am afraid, much for the worse,&rdquo;
said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed he has, sir; but we must not complain,&rdquo;
replied she. &ldquo;We have to thank God that we have
lodging and food, though it&rsquo;s poor enough, it is, your
honour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor child! thought I. How many an older head
might learn wisdom from thee&mdash;how many a luxurious
philosopher, who is skilled to preach but not to suffer,
might not thy patient words put to the blush! The
manner and language of my companion were alike
above her years and station; and, indeed, in all cases
in which the cares and sorrows of life have anticipated
their usual date, and have fallen, as they sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
do, with melancholy prematurity to the lot of childhood,
I have observed the result to have proved
uniformly the same. A young mind, to which joy
and indulgence have been strangers, and to which
suffering and self-denial have been familiarized from
the first, acquires a solidity and an elevation which no
other discipline could have bestowed, and which, in
the present case, communicated a striking but mournful
peculiarity to the manners, even to the voice, of
the child. We paused before a narrow, crazy door,
which she opened by means of a latch, and we forthwith
began to ascend the steep and broken stairs
which led to the sick man&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>As we mounted flight after flight towards the
garret-floor, I heard more and more distinctly the
hurried talking of many voices. I could also distinguish
the low sobbing of a female. On arriving
upon the uppermost lobby, these sounds became fully
audible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This way, your honour,&rdquo; said my little conductress;
at the same time, pushing open a door of patched
and half-rotten plank, she admitted me into the
squalid chamber of death and misery. But one
candle, held in the fingers of a scared and haggard-looking
child, was burning in the room, and that so
dim that all was twilight or darkness except within
its immediate influence. The general obscurity, however,
served to throw into prominent and startling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
relief the death-bed and its occupant. The light
fell with horrible clearness upon the blue and
swollen features of the drunkard. I did not think
it possible that a human countenance could look
so terrific. The lips were black and drawn apart;
the teeth were firmly set; the eyes a little unclosed,
and nothing but the whites appearing. Every
feature was fixed and livid, and the whole face
wore a ghastly and rigid expression of despairing
terror such as I never saw equalled. His hands
were crossed upon his breast, and firmly clenched;
while, as if to add to the corpse-like effect of the
whole, some white cloths, dipped in water, were
wound about the forehead and temples.</p>

<p>As soon as I could remove my eyes from this
horrible spectacle, I observed my friend Dr. D&mdash;&mdash;,
one of the most humane of a humane profession,
standing by the bedside. He had been attempting,
but unsuccessfully, to bleed the patient, and had now
applied his finger to the pulse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any hope?&rdquo; I inquired in a whisper.</p>

<p>A shake of the head was the reply. There was a
pause, while he continued to hold the wrist; but he
waited in vain for the throb of life&mdash;it was not there:
and when he let go the hand, it fell stiffly back into
its former position upon the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man is dead,&rdquo; said the physician, as he turned
from the bed where the terrible figure lay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Dead! thought I, scarcely venturing to look upon
the tremendous and revolting spectacle. Dead!
without an hour for repentance, even a moment for reflection.
Dead! without the rites which even the best
should have. Was there a hope for him? The glaring
eyeball, the grinning mouth, the distorted brow&mdash;that
unutterable look in which a painter would have
sought to embody the fixed despair of the nethermost
hell&mdash;These were my answer.</p>

<p>The poor wife sat at a little distance, crying as if
her heart would break&mdash;the younger children clustered
round the bed, looking with wondering curiosity upon
the form of death, never seen before.</p>

<p>When the first tumult of uncontrollable sorrow had
passed away, availing myself of the solemnity and
impressiveness of the scene, I desired the heart-stricken
family to accompany me in prayer, and all
knelt down while I solemnly and fervently repeated
some of those prayers which appeared most applicable
to the occasion. I employed myself thus in a manner
which I trusted was not unprofitable, at least to the
living, for about ten minutes; and having accomplished
my task, I was the first to arise.</p>

<p>I looked upon the poor, sobbing, helpless creatures
who knelt so humbly around me, and my heart bled
for them. With a natural transition I turned my
eyes from them to the bed in which the body lay;
and, great God! what was the revulsion, the horror<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
which I experienced on seeing the corpse-like, terrific
thing seated half upright before me. The white cloths
which had been wound about the head had now partly
slipped from their position, and were hanging in
grotesque festoons about the face and shoulders,
while the distorted eyes leered from amid them&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;A sight to dream of, not to tell.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>I stood actually riveted to the spot. The figure
nodded its head and lifted its arm, I thought, with a
menacing gesture. A thousand confused and horrible
thoughts at once rushed upon my mind. I had often
read that the body of a presumptuous sinner, who,
during life, had been the willing creature of every
satanic impulse, had been known, after the human
tenant had deserted it, to become the horrible sport
of demoniac possession.</p>

<p>I was roused by the piercing scream of the mother,
who now, for the first time, perceived the change
which had taken place. She rushed towards the bed,
but, stunned by the shock and overcome by the conflict
of violent emotions, before she reached it she fell
prostrate upon the floor.</p>

<p>I am perfectly convinced that had I not been
startled from the torpidity of horror in which I was
bound by some powerful and arousing stimulant, I
should have gazed upon this unearthly apparition
until I had fairly lost my senses. As it was, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the spell was broken&mdash;superstition gave way to
reason: the man whom all believed to have been
actually dead was living!</p>

<p>Dr. D&mdash;&mdash; was instantly standing by the bedside,
and upon examination he found that a sudden and
copious flow of blood had taken place from the
wound which the lancet had left; and this, no doubt,
had effected his sudden and almost preternatural
restoration to an existence from which all thought
he had been for ever removed. The man was still
speechless, but he seemed to understand the physician
when he forbade his repeating the painful and fruitless
attempts which he made to articulate, and he at once
resigned himself quietly into his hands.</p>

<p>I left the patient with leeches upon his temples,
and bleeding freely, apparently with little of the
drowsiness which accompanies apoplexy. Indeed, Dr.
D&mdash;&mdash; told me that he had never before witnessed a
seizure which seemed to combine the symptoms of
so many kinds, and yet which belonged to none of
the recognized classes; it certainly was not apoplexy,
catalepsy, nor <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">delirium tremens</i>, and yet it seemed,
in some degree, to partake of the properties of all.
It was strange, but stranger things are coming.</p>

<p>During two or three days Dr. D&mdash;&mdash; would not
allow his patient to converse in a manner which
could excite or exhaust him, with anyone; he suffered
him merely as briefly as possible to express his immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
wants. And it was not until the fourth day
after my early visit, the particulars of which I have
just detailed, that it was thought expedient that I
should see him, and then only because it appeared
that his extreme importunity and impatience to meet
me were likely to retard his recovery more than the
mere exhaustion attendant upon a short conversation
could possibly do. Perhaps, too, my friend entertained
some hope that if by holy confession his
patient&rsquo;s bosom were eased of the perilous stuff which
no doubt oppressed it, his recovery would be more
assured and rapid. It was then, as I have said,
upon the fourth day after my first professional call,
that I found myself once more in the dreary chamber
of want and sickness.</p>

<p>The man was in bed, and appeared low and restless.
On my entering the room he raised himself in
the bed, and muttered, twice or thrice,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God! thank God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I signed to those of his family who stood by to
leave the room, and took a chair beside the bed.
So soon as we were alone, he said, rather doggedly,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use in telling me of the sinfulness of
bad ways&mdash;I know it all. I know where they lead
to&mdash;I have seen everything about it with my own eyesight,
as plain as I see you.&rdquo; He rolled himself in
the bed, as if to hide his face in the clothes; and
then suddenly raising himself, he exclaimed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
startling vehemence, &ldquo;Look, sir! there is no use in
mincing the matter: I&rsquo;m blasted with the fires of
hell; I have been in hell. What do you think
of that? In hell&mdash;I&rsquo;m lost for ever&mdash;I have not
a chance. I am damned already&mdash;damned&mdash;damned!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The end of this sentence he actually shouted.
His vehemence was perfectly terrific; he threw himself
back, and laughed, and sobbed hysterically. I
poured some water into a tea-cup, and gave it to
him. After he had swallowed it, I told him if he
had anything to communicate, to do so as briefly as
he could, and in a manner as little agitating to himself
as possible; threatening at the same time, though
I had no intention of doing so, to leave him at once
in case he again gave way to such passionate excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only foolishness,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;for me to
try to thank you for coming to such a villain as
myself at all. It&rsquo;s no use for me to wish good to
you, or to bless you; for such as me has no blessings
to give.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told him that I had but done my duty, and
urged him to proceed to the matter which weighed
upon his mind. He then spoke nearly as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came in drunk on Friday night last, and got to
my bed here; I don&rsquo;t remember how. Sometime in
the night it seemed to me I wakened, and feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
unasy in myself, I got up out of the bed. I wanted
the fresh air; but I would not make a noise to open
the window, for fear I&rsquo;d waken the crathurs. It was
very dark and throublesome to find the door; but at
last I did get it, and I groped my way out, and went
down as asy as I could. I felt quite sober, and I
counted the steps one after another, as I was going
down, that I might not stumble at the bottom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I came to the first landing-place&mdash;God be
about us always!&mdash;the floor of it sunk under me, and
I went down&mdash;down&mdash;down, till the senses almost
left me. I do not know how long I was falling, but
it seemed to me a great while. When I came rightly
to myself at last, I was sitting near the top of a great
table; and I could not see the end of it, if it had
any, it was so far off. And there was men beyond
reckoning sitting down all along by it, at each side,
as far as I could see at all. I did not know at first
was it in the open air; but there was a close
smothering feel in it that was not natural. And
there was a kind of light that my eyesight never saw
before, red and unsteady; and I did not see for a
long time where it was coming from, until I looked
straight up, and then I seen that it came from great
balls of blood-coloured fire that were rolling high
overhead with a sort of rushing, trembling sound,
and I perceived that they shone on the ribs of a great
roof of rock that was arched overhead instead of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
sky. When I seen this, scarce knowing what I did,
I got up, and I said, &lsquo;I have no right to be here; I
must go.&rsquo; And the man that was sitting at my left
hand only smiled, and said, &lsquo;Sit down again; you
can <em>never</em> leave this place.&rsquo; And his voice was
weaker than any child&rsquo;s voice I ever heerd; and
when he was done speaking he smiled again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I spoke out very loud and bold, and I said,
&lsquo;In the name of God, let me out of this bad place.&rsquo;
And there was a great man that I did not see before,
sitting at the end of the table that I was near; and
he was taller than twelve men, and his face was very
proud and terrible to look at. And he stood up and
stretched out his hand before him; and when he
stood up, all that was there, great and small, bowed
down with a sighing sound; and a dread came on my
heart, and he looked at me, and I could not speak.
I felt I was his own, to do what he liked with, for I
knew at once who he was; and he said, &lsquo;If you
promise to return, you may depart for a season;&rsquo; and
the voice he spoke with was terrible and mournful,
and the echoes of it went rolling and swelling down
the endless cave, and mixing with the trembling of
the fire overhead; so that when he sat down there
was a sound after him, all through the place, like the
roaring of a furnace. And I said, with all the strength
I had, &lsquo;I promise to come back&mdash;in God&rsquo;s name let
me go!&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And with that I lost the sight and the hearing of
all that was there, and when my senses came to me
again, I was sitting in the bed with the blood all
over me, and you and the rest praying around the
room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here he paused, and wiped away the chill drops
which hung upon his forehead.</p>

<p>I remained silent for some moments. The vision
which he had just described struck my imagination
not a little, for this was long before Vathek and the
&ldquo;Hall of Eblis&rdquo; had delighted the world; and the
description which he gave had, as I received it, all
the attractions of novelty beside the impressiveness
which always belongs to the narration of an <em>eye-witness</em>,
whether in the body or in the spirit, of the
scenes which he describes. There was something,
too, in the stern horror with which the man related
these things, and in the incongruity of his description
with the vulgarly received notions of the great
place of punishment, and of its presiding spirit, which
struck my mind with awe, almost with fear. At
length he said, with an expression of horrible, imploring
earnestness, which I shall never forget,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, is there any hope; is there any chance
at all? or is my soul pledged and promised away
for ever? is it gone out of my power? must I go
back to the place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In answering him, I had no easy task to perform;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
for however clear might be my internal conviction of
the groundlessness of his fears, and however strong
my scepticism respecting the reality of what he had
described, I nevertheless felt that his impression to
the contrary, and his humility and terror resulting
from it, might be made available as no mean engines
in the work of his conversion from profligacy, and
of his restoration to decent habits and to religious
feeling.</p>

<p>I therefore told him that he was to regard his
dream rather in the light of a warning than in that
of a prophecy; that our salvation depended not upon
the word or deed of a moment, but upon the habits
of a life; that, in fine, if he at once discarded his idle
companions and evil habits, and firmly adhered to a
sober, industrious, and religious course of life, the
powers of darkness might claim his soul in vain, for
that there were higher and firmer pledges than human
tongue could utter, which promised salvation to him
who should repent and lead a new life.</p>

<p>I left him much comforted, and with a promise to
return upon the next day. I did so, and found him
much more cheerful, and without any remains of the
dogged sullenness which I suppose had arisen from
his despair. His promises of amendment were given
in that tone of deliberate earnestness which belongs
to deep and solemn determination; and it was with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
no small delight that I observed, after repeated visits,
that his good resolutions, so far from failing, did but
gather strength by time; and when I saw that man
shake off the idle and debauched companions whose
society had for years formed alike his amusement
and his ruin, and revive his long-discarded habits of
industry and sobriety, I said within myself, There is
something more in all this than the operation of an
idle dream.</p>

<p>One day, some time after his perfect restoration to
health, I was surprised, on ascending the stairs for
the purpose of visiting this man, to find him busily
employed in nailing down some planks upon the
landing-place, through which, at the commencement
of his mysterious vision, it seemed to him that he
had sunk. I perceived at once that he was strengthening
the floor with a view to securing himself
against such a catastrophe, and could scarcely forbear
a smile as I bid &ldquo;God bless his work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He perceived my thoughts, I suppose, for he immediately
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can never pass over that floor without trembling.
I&rsquo;d leave this house if I could, but I can&rsquo;t find another
lodging in the town so cheap, and I&rsquo;ll not take a
better till I&rsquo;ve paid off all my debts, please God;
but I could not be asy in my mind till I made it as
safe as I could. You&rsquo;ll hardly believe me, your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
honour, that while I&rsquo;m working, maybe a mile away,
my heart is in a flutter the whole way back, with the
bare thoughts of the two little steps I have to walk
upon this bit of a floor. So it&rsquo;s no wonder, sir, I&rsquo;d
thry to make it sound and firm with any idle timber
I have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I applauded his resolution to pay off his debts,
and the steadiness with which he perused his plans of
conscientious economy, and passed on.</p>

<p>Many months elapsed, and still there appeared no
alteration in his resolutions of amendment. He was
a good workman, and with his better habits he
recovered his former extensive and profitable employment.
Everything seemed to promise comfort and
respectability. I have little more to add, and that
shall be told quickly. I had one evening met Pat
Connell, as he returned from his work, and as usual,
after a mutual, and on his side respectful salutation,
I spoke a few words of encouragement and
approval. I left him industrious, active, healthy&mdash;when
next I saw him, not three days after, he was
a corpse.</p>

<p>The circumstances which marked the event of his
death were somewhat strange&mdash;I might say fearful.
The unfortunate man had accidentally met an old
friend just returned, after a long absence; and in a
moment of excitement, forgetting everything in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
warmth of his joy, he yielded to his urgent invitation
to accompany him into a public house, which lay
close by the spot where the encounter had taken
place. Connell, however, previously to entering the
room, had announced his determination to take
nothing more than the strictest temperance would
warrant.</p>

<p>But oh! who can describe the inveterate tenacity
with which a drunkard&rsquo;s habits cling to him through
life? He may repent, he may reform, he may look
with actual abhorrence upon his past profligacy; but
amid all this reformation and compunction, who can
tell the moment in which the base and ruinous propensity
may not recur, triumphing over resolution,
remorse, shame, everything, and prostrating its victim
once more in all that is destructive and revolting in
that fatal vice?</p>

<p>The wretched man left the place in a state of utter
intoxication. He was brought home nearly insensible,
and placed in his bed. The younger
part of the family retired to rest much after their
usual hour; but the poor wife remained up sitting
by the fire, too much grieved and shocked at the
occurrence of what she had so little expected, to
settle to rest. Fatigue, however, at length overcame
her, and she sank gradually into an uneasy slumber.
She could not tell how long she had remained in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
state; but when she awakened, and immediately on
opening her eyes, she perceived by the faint red light
of the smouldering turf embers, two persons, one
of whom she recognized as her husband, noiselessly
gliding out of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pat, darling, where are you going?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>There was no answer&mdash;the door closed after them;
but in a moment
she was startled
and terrified by a
loud and heavy crash, as if some ponderous body had
been hurled down the stair.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill11.jpg" width="364" height="296"
alt="NOISELESSLY GLIDING OUT OF THE ROOM." title="NOISELESSLY GLIDING OUT OF THE ROOM." />
</div>

<p>Much alarmed, she started up, and going to the
head of the staircase, she called repeatedly upon her
husband, but in vain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>She returned to the room, and with the assistance
of her daughter, whom I had occasion to mention
before, she succeeded in finding and lighting a
candle, with which she hurried again to the head of
the staircase.</p>

<p>At the bottom lay what seemed to be a bundle of
clothes, heaped together, motionless, lifeless&mdash;it was
her husband. In going down the stairs, for what
purpose can never now be known, he had fallen
helplessly and violently to the bottom, and coming
head foremost, the spine of the neck had been dislocated
by the shock, and instant death must have
ensued.</p>

<p>The body lay upon that landing-place to which
his dream had referred.</p>

<p>It is scarcely worth endeavouring to clear up a
single point in a narrative where all is mystery;
yet I could not help suspecting that the second
figure which had been seen in the room by Connell&rsquo;s
wife on the night of his death might have been no
other than his own shadow.</p>

<p>I suggested this solution of the difficulty; but
she told me that the unknown person had been considerably
in advance of her husband, and on reaching
the door, had turned back as if to communicate something
to his companion.</p>

<p>It was, then, a mystery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter">

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>Was the dream verified?&mdash;whither had the disembodied
spirit sped? who can say? We know not.
But I left the house of death that day in a state
of horror which I could not describe. It seemed to
me that I was scarce awake. I heard and saw everything
as if under the spell of a nightmare. The
coincidence was terrible.</p>

<p>In the following narrative I have endeavoured to
give as nearly as possible the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipsissima verba</i> of the
valued friend from whom I received it, conscious that
any aberration from <em>her</em> mode of telling the tale of
her own life would at once impair its accuracy and
its effect.</p>

<p>Would that, with her words, I could also bring
before you her animated gesture, the expressive
countenance, the solemn and thrilling air and accent
with which she related the dark passages in her
strange story; and, above all, that I could communicate
the impressive consciousness that the narrator
had seen with her own eyes, and personally acted in
the scenes which she described. These accompaniments,
taken with the additional circumstance that
she who told the tale was one far too deeply and
sadly impressed with religious principle to misrepresent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
or fabricate what she repeated as fact,
gave to the tale a depth of interest which the recording
of the events themselves could hardly have produced.</p>

<p>I became acquainted with the lady from whose
lips I heard this narrative nearly twenty years since,
and the story struck my fancy so much that I
committed it to paper while it was still fresh in my
mind; and should its perusal afford you entertainment
for a listless half hour, my labour shall not
have been bestowed in vain.</p>

<p>I find that I have taken the story down as she
told it, in the first person, and perhaps this is as it
should be.</p>

<p>She began as follows:</p>

<p>My maiden name was Richardson, the designation
of a family of some distinction in the county of
Tyrone. I was the younger of two daughters, and
we were the only children. There was a difference
in our ages of nearly six years, so that I did not, in
my childhood, enjoy that close companionship which
sisterhood, in other circumstances, necessarily involves;
and while I was still a child, my sister was
married.</p>

<p>The person upon whom she bestowed her hand was
a Mr. Carew, a gentleman of property and consideration
in the north of England.</p>

<p>I remember well the eventful day of the wedding;
the thronging carriages, the noisy menials, the loud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
laughter, the merry faces, and the gay dresses. Such
sights were then new to me, and harmonized ill with
the sorrowful feelings with which I regarded the
event which was to separate me from a sister whose
tenderness alone had hitherto more than supplied
all that I wanted in my mother&rsquo;s affection.</p>

<p>The day soon arrived which was to remove the
happy couple from Ashtown House. The carriage
stood at the hall-door, and my poor sister kissed me
again and again, telling me that I should see her soon.</p>

<p>The carriage drove away, and I gazed after it
until my eyes filled with tears, and, returning slowly
to my chamber, I wept more bitterly and, so to speak,
more desolately, than ever I had wept before.</p>

<p>My father had never seemed to love or to take an
interest in me. He had desired a son, and I think
he never thoroughly forgave me my unfortunate sex.</p>

<p>My having come into the world at all as his child
he regarded as a kind of fraudulent intrusion; and as
his antipathy to me had its origin in an imperfection
of mine too radical for removal, I never even hoped
to stand high in his good graces.</p>

<p>My mother was, I dare say, as fond of me as she
was of anyone; but she was a woman of a masculine
and a worldly cast of mind. She had no tenderness
or sympathy for the weaknesses, or even for the affections,
of woman&rsquo;s nature, and her demeanour towards
me was peremptory, and often even harsh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not to be supposed, then, that I found in the
society of my parents much to supply the loss of my
sister. About a year after her marriage, we received
letters from Mr. Carew, containing accounts of my
sister&rsquo;s health, which, though not actually alarming,
were calculated to make us seriously uneasy. The
symptoms most dwelt upon were loss of appetite, and
a cough.</p>

<p>The letters concluded by intimating that he would
avail himself of my father and mother&rsquo;s repeated invitation
to spend some time at Ashtown, particularly
as the physician who had been consulted as to my
sister&rsquo;s health had strongly advised a removal to her
native air.</p>

<p>There were added repeated assurances that nothing
serious was apprehended, as it was supposed that a
deranged state of the liver was the only source of the
symptoms which at first had seemed to intimate
consumption.</p>

<p>In accordance with this announcement, my sister
and Mr. Carew arrived in Dublin, where one of my
father&rsquo;s carriages awaited them, in readiness to start
upon whatever day or hour they might choose for
their departure.</p>

<p>It was arranged that Mr. Carew was, as soon as
the day upon which they were to leave Dublin was
definitely fixed, to write to my father, who intended
that the two last stages should be performed by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
own horses, upon whose speed and safety far more
reliance might be placed than upon those of the
ordinary post-horses, which were at that time,
almost without exception, of the very worst order.
The journey, one of about ninety miles, was to be
divided; the larger portion being reserved for the
second day.</p>

<p>On Sunday a letter reached us, stating that the
party would leave Dublin on Monday, and in due
course reach Ashtown upon Tuesday evening.</p>

<p>Tuesday came: the evening closed in, and yet no
carriage; darkness came on, and still no sign of our
expected visitors.</p>

<p>Hour after hour passed away, and it was now past
twelve; the night was remarkably calm, scarce a
breath stirring, so that any sound, such as that
produced by the rapid movement of a vehicle, would
have been audible at a considerable distance. For
some such sound I was feverishly listening.</p>

<p>It was, however, my father&rsquo;s rule to close the
house at nightfall, and the window-shutters being
fastened, I was unable to reconnoitre the avenue as
I would have wished. It was nearly one o&rsquo;clock, and
we began almost to despair of seeing them upon that
night, when I thought I distinguished the sound of
wheels, but so remote and faint as to make me at
first very uncertain. The noise approached; it became
louder and clearer; it stopped for a moment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>I now heard the shrill screaming of the rusty iron,
as the avenue gate revolved on its hinges; again
came the sound of wheels in rapid motion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is they,&rdquo; said I, starting up; &ldquo;the carriage is
in the avenue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We all stood for a few moments breathlessly listening.
On thundered the vehicle with the speed of the
whirlwind; crack went the whip, and clatter went
the wheels, as it rattled over the uneven pavement of
the court. A general and furious barking from all
the dogs about the house hailed its arrival.</p>

<p>We hurried to the hall in time to hear the steps
let down with the sharp clanging noise peculiar to
the operation, and the hum of voices exerted in the
bustle of arrival. The hall door was now thrown
open, and we all stepped forth to greet our visitors.</p>

<p>The court was perfectly empty; the moon was
shining broadly and brightly upon all around;
nothing was to be seen but the tall trees with their
long spectral shadows, now wet with the dews of
midnight.</p>

<p>We stood gazing from right to left as if suddenly
awakened from a dream; the dogs walked suspiciously,
growling and snuffling about the court, and
by totally and suddenly ceasing their former loud
barking, expressed the predominance of fear.</p>

<p>We stared one upon another in perplexity and
dismay, and I think I never beheld more pale faces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
assembled. By my father&rsquo;s directions, we looked
about to find anything which might indicate or
account for the noise which we had heard; but no
such thing was to be seen&mdash;even the mire which lay
upon the avenue was undisturbed. We returned to
the house, more panic-struck than I can describe.</p>

<p>On the next day, we learned by a messenger, who
had ridden hard the greater part of the night, that
my sister was dead. On Sunday evening she had
retired to bed rather unwell, and on Monday her
indisposition declared itself unequivocally to be
malignant fever. She became hourly worse, and, on
Tuesday night, a little after midnight, she expired.</p>

<p>I mention this circumstance, because it was one
upon which a thousand wild and fantastical reports
were founded, though one would have thought
that the truth scarcely required to be improved
upon; and again, because it produced a strong
and lasting effect upon my spirits, and indeed, I
am inclined to think, upon my character.</p>

<p>I was, for several years after this occurrence,
long after the violence of my grief subsided, so
wretchedly low-spirited and nervous, that I could
scarcely be said to live; and during this time, habits
of indecision, arising out of a listless acquiescence in
the will of others, a fear of encountering even the
slightest opposition, and a disposition to shrink from
what are commonly called amusements, grew upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
me so strongly, that I have scarcely even yet altogether
overcome them.</p>

<p>We saw nothing more of Mr. Carew. He returned
to England as soon as the melancholy rites attendant
upon the event which I have just mentioned were
performed; and not being altogether inconsolable,
he married again within two years; after which,
owing to the remoteness of our relative situations,
and other circumstances, we gradually lost sight of
him.</p>

<p>I was now an only child; and, as my elder sister
had died without issue, it was evident that, in the
ordinary course of things, my father&rsquo;s property, which
was altogether in his power, would go to me; and
the consequence was, that before I was fourteen,
Ashtown House was besieged by a host of suitors.
However, whether it was that I was too young, or
that none of the aspirants to my hand stood sufficiently
high in rank or wealth, I was suffered by both
parents to do exactly as I pleased; and well was it
for me, as I afterwards found, that fortune, or rather
Providence, had so ordained it, that I had not suffered
my affections to become in any degree engaged, for
my mother would never have suffered any silly fancy
of mine, as she was in the habit of styling an attachment,
to stand in the way of her ambitious views&mdash;views
which she was determined to carry into effect
in defiance of every obstacle, and in order to accomplish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
which she would not have hesitated to sacrifice
anything so unreasonable and contemptible as a
girlish passion.</p>

<p>When I reached the age of sixteen, my mother&rsquo;s
plans began to develop themselves; and, at her
suggestion, we moved to Dublin to sojourn for the
winter, in order that no time might be lost in disposing
of me to the best advantage.</p>

<p>I had been too long accustomed to consider myself
as of no importance whatever, to believe for a moment
that I was in reality the cause of all the bustle and
preparation which surrounded me; and being thus
relieved from the pain which a consciousness of my
real situation would have inflicted, I journeyed
towards the capital with a feeling of total indifference.</p>

<p>My father&rsquo;s wealth and connection had established
him in the best society, and consequently, upon our
arrival in the metropolis, we commanded whatever
enjoyment or advantages its gaieties afforded.</p>

<p>The tumult and novelty of the scenes in which I
was involved did not fail considerably to amuse me,
and my mind gradually recovered its tone, which was
naturally cheerful.</p>

<p>It was almost immediately known and reported
that I was an heiress, and of course my attractions
were pretty generally acknowledged.</p>

<p>Among the many gentlemen whom it was my fortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
to please, one, ere long, established himself in
my mother&rsquo;s good graces, to the exclusion of all less
important aspirants. However, I had not understood
or even remarked his attentions, nor in the slightest
degree suspected his or my mother&rsquo;s plans respecting
me, when I was made aware of them rather abruptly
by my mother herself.</p>

<p>We had attended a splendid ball, given by Lord
M&mdash;&mdash;, at his residence in Stephen&rsquo;s Green, and I
was, with the assistance of my waiting-maid, employed
in rapidly divesting myself of the rich ornaments
which, in profuseness and value, could scarcely
have found their equals in any private family in
Ireland.</p>

<p>I had thrown myself into a lounging-chair beside
the fire, listless and exhausted after the fatigues of
the evening, when I was aroused from the reverie
into which I had fallen by the sound of footsteps
approaching my chamber, and my mother entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fanny, my dear,&rdquo; said she, in her softest tone, &ldquo;I
wish to say a word or two with you before I go to
rest. You are not fatigued, love, I hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, madam, I thank you,&rdquo; said I, rising at
the same time from my seat, with the formal respect
so little practised now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down, my dear,&rdquo; said she, placing herself
upon a chair beside me; &ldquo;I must chat with you for
a quarter of an hour or so. Saunders&rdquo; (to the maid),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
&ldquo;you may leave the room; do not close the room
door, but shut that of the lobby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This precaution against curious ears having been
taken as directed, my mother proceeded:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have observed, I should suppose, my dearest
Fanny&mdash;indeed, you <em>must</em> have observed Lord Glenfallen&rsquo;s
marked attentions to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assure you, madam&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, that is all right,&rdquo; interrupted my
mother. &ldquo;Of course, you must be modest upon the
matter; but listen to me for a few moments, my
love, and I will prove to your satisfaction that your
modesty is quite unnecessary in this case. You have
done better than we could have hoped, at least, so
very soon. Lord Glenfallen is in love with you. I
give you joy of your conquest;&rdquo; and, saying this,
my mother kissed my forehead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In love with me!&rdquo; I exclaimed in unfeigned
astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, in love with you,&rdquo; repeated my mother;
&ldquo;devotedly, distractedly in love with you. Why,
my dear, what is there wonderful in it? Look in the
glass, and look at these,&rdquo; she continued, pointing,
with a smile, to the jewels which I had just removed
from my person, and which now lay in a glittering
heap upon the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May there not&mdash;&rdquo; said I, hesitating between
confusion and real alarm, &ldquo;is it not possible that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
some mistake may be at the bottom of all
this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistake, dearest! none,&rdquo; said my mother.
&ldquo;None; none in the world. Judge for yourself;
read this, my love.&rdquo; And she placed in my hand a
letter, addressed to herself, the seal of which was
broken. I read it through with no small surprise.
After some very fine complimentary flourishes upon
my beauty and perfections, as also upon the antiquity
and high reputation of our family, it went on to
make a formal proposal of marriage, to be communicated
or not to me at present, as my mother should
deem expedient; and the letter wound up by a
request that the writer might be permitted, upon our
return to Ashtown House, which was soon to take
place, as the spring was now tolerably advanced, to
visit us for a few days, in case his suit was approved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, my dear,&rdquo; said my mother, impatiently;
&ldquo;do you know who Lord Glenfallen is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, madam,&rdquo; said I, rather timidly; for I
dreaded an altercation with my mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, dear, and what frightens you?&rdquo; continued
she. &ldquo;Are you afraid of a title? What has he done
to alarm you? He is neither old nor ugly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was silent, though I might have said, &ldquo;He is
neither young nor handsome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Fanny,&rdquo; continued my mother, &ldquo;in
sober seriousness, you have been most fortunate in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
engaging the affections of a nobleman such as Lord
Glenfallen, young and wealthy, with first-rate&mdash;yes,
acknowledged <em>first-rate</em> abilities, and of a family
whose influence is not exceeded by that of any in
Ireland. Of course, you see the offer in the same
light that I do&mdash;indeed, I think you <em>must</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was uttered in no very dubious tone. I was so
much astonished by the suddenness of the whole communication,
that I literally did not know what to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not in love?&rdquo; said my mother, turning
sharply, and fixing her dark eyes upon me with
severe scrutiny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, madam,&rdquo; said I, promptly; horrified&mdash;what
young lady would not have been?&mdash;at such a query.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it,&rdquo; said my mother, drily.
&ldquo;Once, nearly twenty years ago, a friend of mine
consulted me as to how he should deal with a
daughter who had made what they call a love-match&mdash;beggared
herself, and disgraced her family; and I
said, without hesitation, take no care for her, but cast
her off. Such punishment I awarded for an offence
committed against the reputation of a family not my
own; and what I advised respecting the child of
another, with full as small compunction I would <em>do</em>
with mine. I cannot conceive anything more unreasonable
or intolerable than that the fortune and
the character of a family should be marred by the
idle caprices of a girl.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>She spoke this with great severity, and paused as
if she expected some observation from me.</p>

<p>I, however, said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I need not explain to you, my dear Fanny,&rdquo;
she continued, &ldquo;my views upon this subject; you
have always known them well, and I have never yet
had reason to believe you are likely to offend me
voluntarily, or to abuse or neglect any of those
advantages which reason and duty tell you should be
improved. Come hither, my dear; kiss me, and do
not look so frightened. Well, now, about this letter&mdash;you
need not answer it yet; of course, you must
be allowed time to make up your mind. In the meantime,
I will write to his lordship to give him my permission
to visit us at Ashtown. Good-night, my
love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And thus ended one of the most disagreeable, not
to say astounding, conversations I had ever had. It
would not be easy to describe exactly what were
my feelings towards Lord Glenfallen;&mdash;whatever
might have been my mother&rsquo;s suspicions, my heart
was perfectly disengaged&mdash;and hitherto, although I
had not been made in the slightest degree acquainted
with his real views, I had liked him very much as an
agreeable, well-informed man, whom I was always
glad to meet in society. He had served in the navy
in early life, and the polish which his manners
received in his after intercourse with courts and cities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
had not served to obliterate that frankness of manner
which belongs proverbially to the sailor.</p>

<p>Whether this apparent candour went deeper than
the outward bearing, I was yet to learn. However,
there was no doubt that, as far as I had seen of Lord
Glenfallen, he was, though perhaps not so young as
might have been desired in a lover, a singularly pleasing
man; and whatever feeling unfavourable to him had
found its way into my mind, arose altogether from
the dread, not an unreasonable one, that constraint
might be practised upon my inclinations. I reflected,
however, that Lord Glenfallen was a wealthy man,
and one highly thought of; and although I could
never expect to love him in the romantic sense of the
term, yet I had no doubt but that, all things considered,
I might be more happy with him than I could
hope to be at home.</p>

<p>When next I met him it was with no small embarrassment;
his tact and good breeding, however,
soon reassured me, and effectually prevented my
awkwardness being remarked upon. And I had the
satisfaction of leaving Dublin for the country with
the full conviction that nobody, not even those most
intimate with me, even suspected the fact of Lord
Glenfallen&rsquo;s having made me a formal proposal.</p>

<p>This was to me a very serious subject of self-gratulation,
for, besides my instinctive dread of
becoming the topic of the speculations of gossip, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
felt that if the situation which I occupied in relation
to him were made publicly known, I should stand
committed in a manner which would scarcely leave
me the power of retraction.</p>

<p>The period at which Lord Glenfallen had arranged
to visit Ashtown House was now fast approaching,
and it became my mother&rsquo;s wish to form me
thoroughly to her will, and to obtain my consent to the
proposed marriage before his arrival, so that all things
might proceed smoothly, without apparent opposition
or objection upon my part. Whatever objections, therefore,
I had entertained were to be subdued; whatever
disposition to resistance I had exhibited or had been
supposed to feel, were to be completely eradicated
before he made his appearance; and my mother
addressed herself to the task with a decision and
energy against which even the barriers her imagination
had created could hardly have stood.</p>

<p>If she had, however, expected any determined
opposition from me, she was agreeably disappointed.
My heart was perfectly free, and all my feelings of
liking and preference were in favour of Lord Glenfallen;
and I well knew that in case I refused to dispose
of myself as I was desired, my mother had alike
the power and the will to render my existence as
utterly miserable as even the most ill-assorted
marriage could possibly have made it.</p>

<p>You will remember, my good friend, that I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
very young and very completely under the control of
my parents, both of whom, my mother particularly,
were unscrupulously determined in matters of this
kind, and willing, when voluntary obedience on the
part of those within their power was withheld, to
compel a forced acquiescence by an unsparing use of
all the engines of the most stern and rigorous domestic
discipline.</p>

<p>All these combined, not unnaturally induced me
to resolve upon yielding at once, and without useless
opposition, to what appeared almost to be my fate.</p>

<p>The appointed time was come, and my now
accepted suitor arrived; he was in high spirits, and,
if possible, more entertaining than ever.</p>

<p>I was not, however, quite in the mood to enjoy his
sprightliness; but whatever I wanted in gaiety was
amply made up in the triumphant and gracious good-humour
of my mother, whose smiles of benevolence
and exultation were showered around as bountifully
as the summer sunshine.</p>

<p>I will not weary you with unnecessary details.
Let it suffice to say, that I was married to Lord
Glenfallen with all the attendant pomp and circumstance
of wealth, rank, and grandeur. According to
the usage of the times, now humanely reformed, the
ceremony was made, until long past midnight, the
season of wild, uproarious, and promiscuous feasting
and revelry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>Of all this I have a painfully vivid recollection, and
particularly of the little annoyances inflicted upon
me by the dull and coarse jokes of the wits and wags
who abound in all such places, and upon all such
occasions.</p>

<p>I was not sorry when, after a few days, Lord Glenfallen&rsquo;s
carriage appeared at the door to convey us
both from Ashtown; for any change would have
been a relief from the irksomeness of ceremonial and
formality which the visits received in honour of my
newly-acquired titles hourly entailed upon me.</p>

</div>

<p>It was arranged that we were to proceed to Cahergillagh,
one of the Glenfallen estates, lying, however,
in a southern county; so that, owing to the difficulty
of the roads at the time, a tedious journey of three
days intervened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>I set forth with my noble companion, followed by
the regrets of some, and by the envy of many; though
God knows I little deserved the latter. The three
days of travel were now almost spent, when passing
the brow of a wild heathy hill, the domain of Cahergillagh
opened suddenly upon our view.</p>

<p>It formed a striking and a beautiful scene. A lake
of considerable extent stretching away towards the
west, and reflecting from its broad, smooth waters
the rich glow of the setting sun, was overhung by
steep hills, covered by a rich mantle of velvet sward,
broken here and there by the grey front of some old
rock, and exhibiting on their shelving sides and on their
slopes and hollows every variety of light and shade.
A thick wood of dwarf oak, birch, and hazel skirted
these hills, and clothed the shores of the lake, running
out in rich luxuriance upon every promontory, and
spreading upward considerably upon the side of the
hills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There lies the enchanted castle,&rdquo; said Lord Glenfallen,
pointing towards a considerable level space
intervening between two of the picturesque hills which
rose dimly around the lake.</p>

<p>This little plain was chiefly occupied by the same
low, wild wood which covered the other parts of the
domain; but towards the centre, a mass of taller and
statelier forest trees stood darkly grouped together,
and among them stood an ancient square tower, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
many buildings of a humbler character, forming together
the manor-house, or, as it was more usually
called, the Court of Cahergillagh.</p>

<p>As we approached the level upon which the mansion
stood, the winding road gave us many glimpses of
the time-worn castle and its surrounding buildings;
and seen as it was through the long vistas of the fine
old trees, and with the rich glow of evening upon it,
I have seldom beheld an object more picturesquely
striking.</p>

<p>I was glad to perceive, too, that here and there the
blue curling smoke ascended from stacks of chimneys
now hidden by the rich, dark ivy which, in a great
measure, covered the building. Other indications of
comfort made themselves manifest as we approached;
and indeed, though the place was evidently one of
considerable antiquity, it had nothing whatever of the
gloom of decay about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not, my love,&rdquo; said Lord Glenfallen,
&ldquo;imagine this place worse than it is. I have no taste
for antiquity&mdash;at least I should not choose a house to
reside in because it is old. Indeed, I do not recollect
that I was even so romantic as to overcome my
aversion to rats and rheumatism, those faithful
attendants upon your noble relics of feudalism; and
I much prefer a snug, modern, unmysterious bedroom,
with well-aired sheets, to the waving tapestry,
mildewed cushions, and all the other interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
appliances of romance. However, though I cannot
promise you all the discomfort generally belonging
to an old castle, you will find legends and ghostly lore
enough to claim your respect; and if old Martha be
still to the fore, as I trust she is, you will soon have
a supernatural and appropriate anecdote for every
closet and corner of the mansion. But here we are&mdash;so,
without more ado, welcome to Cahergillagh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We now entered the hall of the castle, and while
the domestics were employed in conveying our trunks
and other luggage which we had brought with us for
immediate use, to the apartments which Lord Glenfallen
had selected for himself and me, I went with
him into a spacious sitting-room, wainscoted with
finely-polished black oak, and hung round with
the portraits of various worthies of the Glenfallen
family.</p>

<p>This room looked out upon an extensive level
covered with the softest green sward, and irregularly
bounded by the wild wood I have before mentioned,
through the leafy arcade formed by whose boughs and
trunks the level beams of the setting sun were pouring.
In the distance a group of dairy-maids were plying
their task, which they accompanied throughout with
snatches of Irish songs which, mellowed by the
distance, floated not unpleasingly to the ear; and
beside them sat or lay, with all the grave importance
of conscious protection, six or seven large dogs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
various kinds. Farther in the distance, and through
the cloisters of the arching wood, two or three ragged
urchins were employed in driving such stray kine as
had wandered farther than the rest to join their fellows.</p>

<p>As I looked upon the scene which I have described,
a feeling of tranquillity and happiness came upon me,
which I have never experienced in so strong a degree;
and so strange to me was the sensation that my eyes
filled with tears.</p>

<p>Lord Glenfallen mistook the cause of my emotion,
and taking me kindly and tenderly by the hand, he
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not suppose, my love, that it is my intention
to <em>settle</em> here. Whenever you desire to leave this, you
have only to let me know your wish, and it shall be
complied with; so I must entreat of you not to
suffer any circumstances which I can control to give
you one moment&rsquo;s uneasiness. But here is old
Martha; you must be introduced to her, one of the
heirlooms of our family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A hale, good-humoured, erect old woman was
Martha, and an agreeable contrast to the grim,
decrepit hag which my fancy had conjured up, as the
depositary of all the horrible tales in which I doubted
not this old place was most fruitful.</p>

<p>She welcomed me and her master with a profusion
of gratulations, alternately kissing our hands and
apologizing for the liberty; until at length Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Glenfallen put an end to this somewhat fatiguing
ceremonial by requesting her to conduct me to my
chamber, if it were prepared for my reception.</p>

<p>I followed Martha up an old-fashioned oak staircase
into a long, dim passage, at the end of which
lay the door which communicated with the apartments
which had been selected for our use; here the
old woman stopped, and respectfully requested me
to proceed.</p>

<p>I accordingly opened the door, and was about to
enter, when something like a mass of black tapestry,
as it appeared, disturbed by my sudden approach,
fell from above the door, so as completely to screen
the aperture; the startling unexpectedness of the
occurrence, and the rustling noise which the drapery
made in its descent, caused me involuntarily to step
two or three paces backward. I turned, smiling and
half-ashamed, to the old servant, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see what a coward I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman looked puzzled, and, without saying
any more, I was about to draw aside the curtain and
enter the room, when, upon turning to do so, I was
surprised to find that nothing whatever interposed to
obstruct the passage.</p>

<p>I went into the room, followed by the servant-woman,
and was amazed to find that it, like the one
below, was wainscoted, and that nothing like drapery
was to be found near the door.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;what has become of
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does your ladyship wish to know?&rdquo; said
the old woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the black curtain that fell across the
door, when I attempted first to come to my chamber?&rdquo;
answered I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cross of Christ about us!&rdquo; said the old
woman, turning suddenly pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, my good friend?&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;you seem frightened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, no, your ladyship,&rdquo; said the old woman,
endeavouring to conceal her agitation; but in vain,
for tottering towards a chair, she sank into it, looking
so deadly pale and horror-struck that I thought
every moment she would faint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merciful God, keep us from harm and danger!&rdquo;
muttered she at length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can have terrified you so?&rdquo; said I,
beginning to fear that she had seen something more
than had met my eye. &ldquo;You appear ill, my poor
woman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, nothing, my lady,&rdquo; said she, rising.
&ldquo;I beg your ladyship&rsquo;s pardon for making so bold.
May the great God defend us from misfortune!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Martha,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;something <em>has</em> frightened you
very much, and I insist on knowing what it is; your
keeping me in the dark upon the subject will make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
me much more uneasy than anything you could tell
me. I desire you, therefore, to let me know what
agitates you; I command you to tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your ladyship said you saw a black curtain
falling across the door when you were coming into
the room,&rdquo; said the old woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but though the whole thing
appears somewhat strange, I cannot see anything in
the matter to agitate you so excessively.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for no good you saw that, my lady,&rdquo; said the
crone; &ldquo;something terrible is coming. It&rsquo;s a sign,
my lady&mdash;a sign that never fails.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Explain, explain what you mean, my good
woman,&rdquo; said I, in spite of myself, catching more
than I could account for, of her superstitious terror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whenever something&mdash;something <em>bad</em> is going
to happen to the Glenfallen family, some one that
belongs to them sees a black handkerchief or curtain
just waved or falling before their faces. I saw it
myself,&rdquo; continued she, lowering her voice, &ldquo;when I
was only a little girl, and I&rsquo;ll never forget it. I often
heard of it before, though I never saw it till then,
nor since, praised be God. But I was going into
Lady Jane&rsquo;s room to waken her in the morning; and
sure enough when I got first to the bed and began to
draw the curtain, something dark was waved across
the division, but only for a moment; and when I saw
rightly into the bed, there she was lying cold and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
dead, God be merciful to me! So, my lady, there is
small blame to me to be daunted when any one of
the family sees it; for it&rsquo;s many the story I heard of
it, though I saw it but once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was not of a superstitious turn of mind, yet I
could not resist a feeling of awe very nearly allied to
the fear which my companion had so unreservedly
expressed; and when you consider my situation,
the loneliness, antiquity, and gloom of the place, you
will allow that the weakness was not without excuse.</p>

<p>In spite of old Martha&rsquo;s boding predictions, however,
time flowed on in an unruffled course. One
little incident, however, though trifling in itself, I
must relate, as it serves to make what follows more
intelligible.</p>

<p>Upon the day after my arrival, Lord Glenfallen of
course desired to make me acquainted with the house
and domain; and accordingly we set forth upon our
ramble. When returning, he became for some time
silent and moody, a state so unusual with him as
considerably to excite my surprise.</p>

<p>I endeavoured by observations and questions to
arouse him&mdash;but in vain. At length, as we approached
the house, he said, as if speaking to himself,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twere madness&mdash;madness&mdash;madness,&rdquo; repeating
the words bitterly; &ldquo;sure and speedy ruin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was here a long pause; and at length,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
turning sharply towards me, in a tone very unlike
that in which he had hitherto addressed me, he
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think it possible that a woman can keep
a secret?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that women are very much
belied upon the score of talkativeness, and that I
may answer your question with the same directness
with which you put it&mdash;I reply that I <em>do</em> think a
woman can keep a secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I do not,&rdquo; said he, drily.</p>

<p>We walked on in silence for a time. I was much
astonished at his unwonted abruptness&mdash;I had almost
said rudeness.</p>

<p>After a considerable pause he seemed to recollect
himself, and with an effort resuming his sprightly
manner, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, the next thing to keeping a secret
well is not to desire to possess one; talkativeness
and curiosity generally go together. Now I shall
make test of you, in the first place, respecting the
latter of these qualities. I shall be your <em>Bluebeard</em>&mdash;tush,
why do I trifle thus? Listen to me, my
dear Fanny; I speak now in solemn earnest. What
I desire is intimately, inseparably connected with
your happiness and honour as well as my own; and
your compliance with my request will not be
difficult. It will impose upon you a very trifling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
restraint during your sojourn here, which certain
events which have occurred since our arrival have
determined me shall not be a long one. You must
promise me, upon your sacred honour, that you will
visit <em>only</em> that part of the castle which can be reached
from the front entrance, leaving the back entrance
and the part of the building commanded immediately
by it to the menials, as also the small garden whose
high wall you see yonder; and never at any time
seek to pry or peep into them, nor to open the door
which communicates from the front part of the house
through the corridor with the back. I do not urge
this in jest or in caprice, but from a solemn
conviction that danger and misery will be the certain
consequences of your not observing what I prescribe.
I cannot explain myself further at present. Promise
me, then, these things, as you hope for peace here
and for mercy hereafter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did make the promise as desired, and he
appeared relieved; his manner recovered all its gaiety
and elasticity: but the recollection of the strange
scene which I have just described dwelt painfully upon
my mind.</p>

<p>More than a month passed away without any
occurrence worth recording; but I was not destined
to leave Cahergillagh without further adventure.
One day, intending to enjoy the pleasant sunshine
in a ramble through the woods, I ran up to my room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
to procure my hat and cloak. Upon entering the
chamber I was surprised and somewhat startled
to find it occupied. Beside the fireplace, and nearly
opposite the door, seated in a large, old-fashioned
elbow-chair, was placed the figure of a lady. She
appeared to be nearer fifty than forty, and was
dressed suitably to her age, in a handsome suit of
flowered silk; she had a profusion of trinkets and
jewellery about her person, and many rings upon her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
fingers. But although very rich, her dress was not
gaudy or in ill taste. But what was remarkable in
the lady was, that although her features were handsome,
and upon the whole pleasing, the pupil of each
eye was dimmed with the whiteness of cataract, and
she was evidently stone-blind. I was for some
seconds so surprised at this unaccountable apparition,
that I could not find words to address her.</p>

<div class="figcenter1">
<img src="images/ill14.jpg" width="383" height="338" alt="" title="" />
<br /><span class="caption">UPON ENTERING THE CHAMBER, I WAS SURPRISED AND SOMEWHAT
STARTLED TO FIND IT OCCUPIED.</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there must be some mistake
here&mdash;this is my bedchamber.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marry come up,&rdquo; said the lady, sharply; &ldquo;<em>your</em>
chamber! Where is Lord Glenfallen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is below, madam,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;and I am convinced
he will be not a little surprised to find you here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think he will,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;with your
good leave; talk of what you know something about.
Tell him I want him. Why does the minx dilly-dally
so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of the awe which this grim lady inspired,
there was something in her air of confident superiority
which, when I considered our relative situations, was
not a little irritating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know, madam, to whom you speak?&rdquo;
said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I neither know nor care,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;but I presume
that you are some one about the house, so again
I desire you, if you wish to continue here, to bring
your master hither forthwith.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I must tell you, madam,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that I am
Lady Glenfallen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said the stranger, rapidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, madam,&rdquo; I repeated, approaching her that
I might be more distinctly heard, &ldquo;that I am Lady
Glenfallen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie, you trull!&rdquo; cried she, in an accent
which made me start, and at the same time, springing
forward, she seized me in her grasp, and shook me
violently, repeating, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie&mdash;it&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; with a
rapidity and vehemence which swelled every vein of
her face. The violence of her action, and the fury
which convulsed her face, effectually terrified me, and
disengaging myself from her grasp, I screamed as
loud as I could for help. The blind woman continued
to pour out a torrent of abuse upon me, foaming
at the mouth with rage, and impotently shaking
her clenched fist towards me.</p>

<p>I heard Lord Glenfallen&rsquo;s step upon the stairs, and
I instantly ran out; as I passed him I perceived that
he was deadly pale, and just caught the words: &ldquo;I
hope that demon has not hurt you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I made some answer, I forget what, and he entered
the chamber, the door of which he locked upon the
inside. What passed within I know not; but I
heard the voices of the two speakers raised in loud
and angry altercation.</p>

<p>I thought I heard the shrill accents of the woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
repeat the words, &ldquo;Let her look to herself;&rdquo; but I
could not be quite sure. This short sentence, however,
was, to my alarmed imagination, pregnant with
fearful meaning.</p>

<p>The storm at length subsided, though not until
after a conference of more than two long hours.
Lord Glenfallen then returned, pale and agitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That unfortunate woman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is out of
her mind. I daresay she treated you to some of her
ravings; but you need not dread any further interruption
from her: I have brought her so far to reason.
She did not hurt you, I trust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but she terrified me beyond
measure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;she is likely to behave better for
the future; and I dare swear that neither you nor she
would desire, after what has passed, to meet again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This occurrence, so startling and unpleasant, so
involved in mystery, and giving rise to so many painful
surmises, afforded me no very agreeable food for
rumination.</p>

<p>All attempts on my part to arrive at the truth were
baffled; Lord Glenfallen evaded all my inquiries, and
at length peremptorily forbade any further allusion to
the matter. I was thus obliged to rest satisfied with
what I had actually seen, and to trust to time to
resolve the perplexities in which the whole transaction
had involved me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Glenfallen&rsquo;s temper and spirits gradually
underwent a complete and most painful change; he
became silent and abstracted, his manner to me was
abrupt and often harsh, some grievous anxiety seemed
ever present to his mind; and under its influence his
spirits sank and his temper became soured.</p>

<p>I soon perceived that his gaiety was rather that
which the stir and excitement of society produce,
than the result of a healthy habit of mind; every
day confirmed me in the opinion, that the considerate
good-nature which I had so much admired in him
was little more than a mere manner; and to my
infinite grief and surprise, the gay, kind, open-hearted
nobleman who had for months followed and flattered
me, was rapidly assuming the form of a gloomy,
morose, and singularly selfish man. This was a bitter
discovery, and I strove to conceal it from myself as
long as I could; but the truth was not to be denied,
and I was forced to believe that my husband no
longer loved me, and that he was at little pains to
conceal the alteration in his sentiments.</p>

<p>One morning after breakfast, Lord Glenfallen had
been for some time walking silently up and down the
room, buried in his moody reflections, when pausing
suddenly, and turning towards me, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have it&mdash;I have it! We must go abroad, and
stay there too; and if that does not answer, why&mdash;why,
we must try some more effectual expedient.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Lady Glenfallen, I have become involved in heavy
embarrassments. A wife, you know, must share the
fortunes of her husband, for better for worse; but I
will waive my right if you prefer remaining here&mdash;here
at Cahergillagh. For I would not have you
seen elsewhere without the state to which your rank
entitles you; besides, it would break your poor
mother&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo; he added, with sneering gravity.
&ldquo;So make up your mind&mdash;Cahergillagh or France.
I will start if possible in a week, so determine between
this and then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He left the room, and in a few moments I saw him
ride past the window, followed by a mounted servant.
He had directed a domestic to inform me that he
should not be back until the next day.</p>

<p>I was in very great doubt as to what course of
conduct I should pursue as to accompanying him in
the continental tour so suddenly determined upon. I
felt that it would be a hazard too great to encounter;
for at Cahergillagh I had always the consciousness to
sustain me, that if his temper at any time led him
into violent or unwarrantable treatment of me, I had
a remedy within reach, in the protection and support
of my own family, from all useful and effective communication
with whom, if once in France, I should
be entirely debarred.</p>

<p>As to remaining at Cahergillagh in solitude, and,
for aught I knew, exposed to hidden dangers, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
appeared to me scarcely less objectionable than the
former proposition; and yet I feared that with one
or other I must comply, unless I was prepared to
come to an actual breach with Lord Glenfallen. Full
of these unpleasing doubts and perplexities, I retired
to rest.</p>

<p>I was wakened, after having slept uneasily for
some hours, by some person shaking me rudely by
the shoulder; a small lamp burned in my room, and
by its light, to my horror and amazement, I discovered
that my visitant was the self-same blind
old lady who had so terrified me a few weeks
before.</p>

<p>I started up in the bed, with a view to ring the
bell, and alarm the domestics; but she instantly
anticipated me by saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not be frightened, silly girl! If I had wished
to harm you, I could have done it while you were
sleeping; I need not have wakened you. Listen to
me, now, attentively and fearlessly, for what I have
to say interests you to the full as much as it does me.
Tell me here, in the presence of God, did Lord Glenfallen
marry you&mdash;<em>actually marry you</em>? Speak the
truth, woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As surely as I live and speak,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;did
Lord Glenfallen marry me, in presence of more than
a hundred witnesses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;he should have told you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
<em>then</em>, before you married him, that he had a wife
living,&mdash;that I am his wife. I feel you tremble&mdash;tush!
do not be frightened. I do not mean to harm you.
Mark me now&mdash;you are <em>not</em> his wife. When I make
my story known you will be so neither in the eye of
God nor of man. You must leave this house upon
to-morrow. Let the world know that your husband
has another wife living; go you into retirement, and
leave him to justice, which will surely overtake him.
If you remain in this house after to-morrow, you
will reap the bitter fruits of your sin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, she quitted the room, leaving me very
little disposed to sleep.</p>

<p>Here was food for my very worst and most terrible
suspicions; still there was not enough to remove all
doubt. I had no proof of the truth of this woman&rsquo;s
statement.</p>

<p>Taken by itself, there was nothing to induce me
to attach weight to it; but when I viewed it in connection
with the extraordinary mystery of some of
Lord Glenfallen&rsquo;s proceedings, his strange anxiety to
exclude me from certain portions of the mansion,
doubtless lest I should encounter this person&mdash;the
strong influence, nay, command which she possessed
over him, a circumstance clearly established by the
very fact of her residing in the very place where, of
all others, he should least have desired to find her&mdash;her
thus acting, and continuing to act in direct contradiction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
to his wishes; when, I say, I viewed her
disclosure in connection with all these circumstances,
I could not help feeling that there was at least a fearful
verisimilitude in the allegations which she had
made.</p>

<p>Still I was not satisfied, nor nearly so. Young
minds have a reluctance almost insurmountable to
believing, upon anything short of unquestionable
proof, the existence of premeditated guilt in anyone
whom they have ever trusted; and in support of this
feeling I was assured that if the assertion of Lord
Glenfallen, which nothing in this woman&rsquo;s manner
had led me to disbelieve, were true, namely that her
mind was unsound, the whole fabric of my doubts
and fears must fall to the ground.</p>

<p>I determined to state to Lord Glenfallen freely and
accurately the substance of the communication which
I had just heard, and in his words and looks to
seek for its proof or refutation. Full of these
thoughts, I remained wakeful and excited all night,
every moment fancying that I heard the step or saw
the figure of my recent visitor, towards whom I felt
a species of horror and dread which I can hardly
describe.</p>

<p>There was something in her face, though her
features had evidently been handsome, and were not,
at first sight, unpleasing, which, upon a nearer inspection,
seemed to indicate the habitual prevalence and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
indulgence of evil passions, and a power of expressing
mere animal anger with an intenseness that I
have seldom seen equalled, and to which an almost
unearthly effect was given by the convulsive quivering
of the sightless eyes.</p>

<p>You may easily suppose that it was no very
pleasing reflection to me to consider that, whenever
caprice might induce her to return, I was within the
reach of this violent and, for aught I knew, insane
woman, who had, upon that very night, spoken to
me in a tone of menace, of which her mere words,
divested of the manner and look with which she
uttered them, can convey but a faint idea.</p>

<p>Will you believe me when I tell you that I was
actually afraid to leave my bed in order to secure the
door, lest I should again encounter the dreadful
object lurking in some corner or peeping from
behind the window-curtains, so very a child was I in
my fears?</p>

<p>The morning came, and with it Lord Glenfallen.
I knew not, and indeed I cared not, where he might
have been; my thoughts were wholly engrossed by
the terrible fears and suspicions which my last
night&rsquo;s conference had suggested to me. He was, as
usual, gloomy and abstracted, and I feared in no
very fitting mood to hear what I had to say with
patience, whether the charges were true or false.</p>

<p>I was, however, determined not to suffer the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
opportunity to pass, or Lord Glenfallen to leave the
room, until, at all hazards, I had unburdened my
mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said I, after a long silence, summoning
up all my firmness, &ldquo;my lord, I wish to say a few
words to you upon a matter of very great importance,
of very deep concernment to you and to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I fixed my eyes upon him to discern, if possible,
whether the announcement caused him any uneasiness;
but no symptom of any such feeling was
perceptible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is no doubt a very
grave preface, and portends, I have no doubt, something
extraordinary. Pray let us have it without
more ado.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took a chair, and seated himself nearly opposite
to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have seen the person who
alarmed me so much a short time since, the blind
lady, again, upon last night.&rdquo; His face, upon which
my eyes were fixed, turned pale; he hesitated for a
moment, and then said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did you, pray, madam, so totally forget or
spurn my express command, as to enter that portion
of the house from which your promise, I might say
your oath, excluded you? Answer me that!&rdquo; he
added fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have neither forgotten your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
<em>commands</em>, since such they were, nor disobeyed them.
I was, last night, wakened from my sleep, as I lay in
my own chamber, and accosted by the person whom
I have mentioned. How she found access to the
room I cannot pretend to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! this must be looked to,&rdquo; said he, half reflectively.
&ldquo;And pray,&rdquo; added he quickly, while in
turn he fixed his eyes upon me, &ldquo;what did this person
say? since some comment upon her communication
forms, no doubt, the sequel to your preface.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your lordship is not mistaken,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;her
statement was so extraordinary that I could not
think of withholding it from you. She told me, my
lord, that you had a wife living at the time you
married me, and that she was that wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Glenfallen became ashy pale, almost livid; he
made two or three efforts to clear his voice to speak,
but in vain, and turning suddenly from me, he
walked to the window. The horror and dismay
which, in the olden time, overwhelmed the woman of
Endor when her spells unexpectedly conjured the
dead into her presence, were but types of what I felt
when thus presented with what appeared to be almost
unequivocal evidence of the guilt whose existence I
had before so strongly doubted.</p>

<p>There was a silence of some moments, during
which it were hard to conjecture whether I or my
companion suffered most.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Glenfallen soon recovered his self-command;
he returned to the table, again sat down, and
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you have told me has so astonished me,
has unfolded such a tissue of motiveless guilt, and in
a quarter from which I had so little reason to look
for ingratitude or treachery, that your announcement
almost deprived me of speech; the person in question,
however, has one excuse, her mind is, as I told you
before, unsettled. You should have remembered
that, and hesitated to receive as unexceptionable
evidence against the honour of your husband, the
ravings of a lunatic. I now tell you that this is the
last time I shall speak to you upon this subject, and,
in the presence of the God who is to judge me, and
as I hope for mercy in the day of judgment, I swear
that the charge thus brought against me is utterly
false, unfounded, and ridiculous. I defy the world in
any point to taint my honour; and, as I have never
taken the opinion of madmen touching your character
or morals, I think it but fair to require that you
will evince a like tenderness for me; and now, once
for all, never again dare to repeat to me your insulting
suspicions, or the clumsy and infamous calumnies
of fools. I shall instantly let the worthy lady who
contrived this somewhat original device understand
fully my opinion upon the matter. Good morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with these words he left me again in doubt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and involved in all the horrors of the most agonizing
suspense.</p>

<p>I had reason to think that Lord Glenfallen wreaked
his vengeance upon the author of the strange story
which I had heard, with a violence which was not
satisfied with mere words, for old Martha, with whom
I was a great favourite, while attending me in my
room, told me that she feared her master had ill-used
the poor blind Dutchwoman, for that she had
heard her scream as if the very life were leaving her,
but added a request that I should not speak of what
she had told me to any one, particularly to the master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know that she is a Dutchwoman?&rdquo;
inquired I, anxious to learn anything whatever that
might throw a light upon the history of this person,
who seemed to have resolved to mix herself up in my
fortunes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my lady,&rdquo; answered Martha, &ldquo;the master
often calls her the Dutch hag, and other names you
would not like to hear, and I am sure she is neither
English nor Irish; for, whenever they talk together,
they speak some queer foreign lingo, and fast enough,
I&rsquo;ll be bound. But I ought not to talk about her at
all; it might be as much as my place is worth to
mention her, only you saw her first yourself, so there
can be no great harm in speaking of her now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long has this lady been here?&rdquo; continued
I.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She came early on the morning after your ladyship&rsquo;s
arrival,&rdquo; answered she; &ldquo;but do not ask me
any more, for the master would think nothing of
turning me out of doors for daring to speak of her at
all, much less to <em>you</em>, my lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did not like to press the poor woman further, for
her reluctance to speak on this topic was evident and
strong.</p>

<p>You will readily believe that upon the very slight
grounds which my information afforded, contradicted
as it was by the solemn oath of my husband, and
derived from what was, at best, a very questionable
source, I could not take any very decisive measures
whatever; and as to the menace of the strange
woman who had thus unaccountably twice intruded
herself into my chamber, although, at the moment,
it occasioned me some uneasiness, it was not, even in
my eyes, sufficiently formidable to induce my departure
from Cahergillagh.</p>

<p>A few nights after the scene which I have just
mentioned, Lord Glenfallen having, as usual, retired
early to his study, I was left alone in the parlour
to amuse myself as best I might.</p>

<p>It was not strange that my thoughts should often
recur to the agitating scenes in which I had recently
taken a part.</p>

<p>The subject of my reflections, the solitude, the
silence, and the lateness of the hour, as also the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
depression of spirits to which I had of late been a
constant prey, tended to produce that nervous excitement
which places us wholly at the mercy of the
imagination.</p>

<p>In order to calm my spirits I was endeavouring to
direct my thoughts into some more pleasing channel,
when I heard, or thought I heard, uttered within a
few yards of me, in an odd, half-sneering tone, the
words,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is blood upon your ladyship&rsquo;s throat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So vivid was the impression that I started to my
feet, and involuntarily placed my hand upon my
neck.</p>

<p>I looked around the room for the speaker, but in
vain.</p>

<p>I went then to the room-door, which I opened, and
peered into the passage, nearly faint with horror lest
some leering, shapeless thing should greet me upon
the threshold.</p>

<p>When I had gazed long enough to assure myself
that no strange object was within sight,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been too much of a rake lately; I am
racking out my nerves,&rdquo; said I, speaking aloud, with
a view to reassure myself.</p>

<p>I rang the bell, and, attended by old Martha, I
retired to settle for the night.</p>

<p>While the servant was&mdash;as was her custom&mdash;arranging
the lamp which I have already stated always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
burned during the night in my chamber, I was employed
in undressing, and, in doing so, I had recourse
to a large looking-glass which occupied a considerable
portion of the wall in which it was fixed, rising from
the ground to a height of about six feet; this mirror
filled the space of a large panel in the wainscoting
opposite the foot of the bed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill15.jpg" width="364" height="374" alt="" title="" />
<br /><span class="caption">SOMETHING LIKE A BLACK PALL WAS SLOWLY WAVED.</span>
</div>

<p>I had hardly been before it for the lapse of a
minute when something like a black pall was slowly
waved between me and it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, God! there it is,&rdquo; I exclaimed, wildly. &ldquo;I
have seen it again, Martha&mdash;the black cloth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God be merciful to us, then!&rdquo; answered she,
tremulously crossing herself. &ldquo;Some misfortune is
over us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, Martha,&rdquo; said I, almost instantly recovering
my collectedness; for, although of a nervous
temperament, I had never been superstitious. &ldquo;I do
not believe in omens. You know I saw, or fancied I
saw, this thing before, and nothing followed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Dutch lady came the next morning,&rdquo; replied
she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But surely her coming scarcely deserved such a
dreadful warning,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is a strange woman, my lady,&rdquo; said Martha;
&ldquo;and she is not <em>gone</em> yet&mdash;mark my words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, Martha,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have not wit
enough to change your opinions, nor inclination to
alter mine; so I will talk no more of the matter.
Good-night,&rdquo; and so I was left to my reflections.</p>

<p>After lying for about an hour awake, I at length
fell into a kind of doze; but my imagination was
very busy, for I was startled from this unrefreshing
sleep by fancying that I heard a voice close to my
face exclaim as before,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is blood upon your ladyship&rsquo;s throat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words were instantly followed by a loud burst
of laughter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>Quaking with horror, I awakened, and heard my
husband enter the room. Even this was a relief.</p>

<p>Scared as I was, however, by the tricks which my
imagination had played me, I preferred remaining
silent, and pretending to sleep, to attempting to engage
my husband in conversation, for I well knew
that his mood was such, that his words would not, in
all probability, convey anything that had not better
be unsaid and unheard.</p>

<p>Lord Glenfallen went into his dressing-room, which
lay upon the right-hand side of the bed. The door
lying open, I could see him by himself, at full length
upon a sofa, and, in about half an hour, I became
aware, by his deep and regularly drawn respiration,
that he was fast asleep.</p>

<p>When slumber refuses to visit one, there is something
peculiarly irritating, not to the temper, but to
the nerves, in the consciousness that some one is in
your immediate presence, actually enjoying the boon
which you are seeking in vain; at least, I have
always found it so, and never more than upon the
present occasion.</p>

<p>A thousand annoying imaginations harassed and
excited me; every object which I looked upon,
though ever so familiar, seemed to have acquired a
strange phantom-like character, the varying shadows
thrown by the flickering of the lamplight seemed
shaping themselves into grotesque and unearthly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
forms, and whenever my eyes wandered to the sleeping
figure of my husband, his features appeared to undergo
the strangest and most demoniacal contortions.</p>

<p>Hour after hour was told by the old clock, and
each succeeding one found me, if possible, less inclined
to sleep than its predecessor.</p>

<p>It was now considerably past three; my eyes, in
their involuntary wanderings, happened to alight
upon the large mirror which was, as I have said,
fixed in the wall opposite the foot of the bed. A
view of it was commanded from where I lay, through
the curtains. As I gazed fixedly upon it, I thought
I perceived the broad sheet of glass shifting its position
in relation to the bed; I riveted my eyes upon
it with intense scrutiny; it was no deception, the
mirror, as if acting of its own impulse, moved slowly
aside, and disclosed a dark aperture in the wall,
nearly as large as an ordinary door; a figure evidently
stood in this, but the light was too dim to define it
accurately.</p>

<p>It stepped cautiously into the chamber, and with
so little noise, that had I not actually seen it, I do
not think I should have been aware of its presence.
It was arrayed in a kind of woollen night-dress, and
a white handkerchief or cloth was bound tightly about
the head; I had no difficulty, spite of the strangeness
of the attire, in recognizing the blind woman whom
I so much dreaded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>She stooped down, bringing her head nearly
to the ground, and in that attitude she remained
motionless for some moments, no doubt in order
to ascertain if any suspicious sounds were stirring.</p>

<p>She was apparently satisfied by her observations,
for she immediately recommenced her silent progress
towards a ponderous mahogany dressing-table of my
husband&rsquo;s. When she had reached it, she paused
again, and appeared to listen attentively for some
minutes; she then noiselessly opened one of the
drawers, from which, having groped for some time,
she took something, which I soon perceived to be a
case of razors. She opened it, and tried the edge of
each of the two instruments upon the skin of her
hand; she quickly selected one, which she fixed
firmly in her grasp. She now stooped down as before,
and having listened for a time, she, with the
hand that was disengaged, groped her way into
the dressing-room where Lord Glenfallen lay fast
asleep.</p>

<p>I was fixed as if in the tremendous spell of a nightmare.
I could not stir even a finger; I could not
lift my voice; I could not even breathe; and though
I expected every moment to see the sleeping man
murdered, I could not even close my eyes to shut out
the horrible spectacle which I had not the power to
avert.</p>

<p>I saw the woman approach the sleeping figure, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
laid the unoccupied hand lightly along his clothes,
and having thus ascertained his identity, she, after a
brief interval, turned back and again entered my
chamber; here she bent down again to listen.</p>

<p>I had now not a doubt but that the razor was intended
for my throat; yet the terrific fascination
which had locked all my powers so long, still continued
to bind me fast.</p>

<p>I felt that my life depended upon the slightest
ordinary exertion, and yet I could not stir one joint
from the position in which I lay, nor even make noise
enough to waken Lord Glenfallen.</p>

<p>The murderous woman now, with long, silent steps,
approached the bed; my very heart seemed turning
to ice; her left hand, that which was disengaged,
was upon the pillow; she gradually slid it forward
towards my head, and in an instant, with the speed
of lightning, it was clutched in my hair, while, with
the other hand, she dashed the razor at my throat.</p>

<p>A slight inaccuracy saved me from instant death;
the blow fell short, the point of the razor grazing
my throat. In a moment, I know not how, I found
myself at the other side of the bed, uttering shriek
after shriek; the wretch was however determined, if
possible, to murder me.</p>

<p>Scrambling along by the curtains, she rushed round
the bed towards me; I seized the handle of the door
to make my escape. It was, however, fastened. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
all events, I could not open it. From the mere instinct
of recoiling terror, I shrunk back into a corner.
She was now within a yard of me. Her hand was
upon my face.</p>

<p>I closed my eyes fast, expecting never to open
them again, when a blow, inflicted from behind by a
strong arm, stretched the monster senseless at my
feet. At the same moment the door opened, and
several domestics, alarmed by my cries, entered the
apartment.</p>

<p>I do not recollect what followed, for I fainted.
One swoon succeeded another, so long and death-like,
that my life was considered very doubtful.</p>

<p>At about ten o&rsquo;clock, however, I sank into a deep
and refreshing sleep, from which I was awakened at
about two, that I might swear my deposition before
a magistrate, who attended for that purpose.</p>

<p>I accordingly did so, as did also Lord Glenfallen,
and the woman was fully committed to stand her
trial at the ensuing assizes.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the scene which the examination
of the blind woman and of the other parties
afforded.</p>

<p>She was brought into the room in the custody of
two servants. She wore a kind of flannel wrapper,
which had not been changed since the night before.
It was torn and soiled, and here and there smeared
with blood, which had flowed in large quantities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
from a wound in her head. The white handkerchief
had fallen off in the scuffle, and her grizzled hair fell
in masses about her wild and deadly pale countenance.</p>

<p>She appeared perfectly composed, however, and
the only regret she expressed throughout, was at not
having succeeded in her attempt, the object of which
she did not pretend to conceal.</p>

<p>On being asked her name, she called herself the
Countess Glenfallen, and refused to give any other
title.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The woman&rsquo;s name is Flora Van-Kemp,&rdquo; said
Lord Glenfallen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <em>was</em>, it <em>was</em>, you perjured traitor and cheat!&rdquo;
screamed the woman; and then there followed a
volley of words in some foreign language. &ldquo;Is there
a magistrate here?&rdquo; she resumed; &ldquo;I am Lord
Glenfallen&rsquo;s wife&mdash;I&rsquo;ll prove it&mdash;write down my
words. I am willing to be hanged or burned, so <em>he</em>
meets his deserts. I did try to kill that doll of his;
but it was he who put it into my head to do it&mdash;two
wives were too many; I was to murder her, or she
was to hang me: listen to all I have to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Lord Glenfallen interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think, sir,&rdquo; said he, addressing the magistrate
&ldquo;that we had better proceed to business; this unhappy
woman&rsquo;s furious recriminations but waste our
time. If she refuses to answer your questions, you
had better, I presume, take my depositions.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And are you going to swear away my life, you
black-perjured murderer?&rdquo; shrieked the woman.
&ldquo;Sir, sir, sir, you must hear me,&rdquo; she continued,
addressing the magistrate; &ldquo;I can convict him&mdash;he
bid me murder that girl, and then, when I failed, he
came behind me, and struck me down, and now he
wants to swear away my life. Take down all
I say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it is your intention,&rdquo; said the magistrate, &ldquo;to
confess the crime with which you stand charged, you
may, upon producing sufficient evidence, criminate
whom you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evidence!&mdash;I have no evidence but myself,&rdquo; said
the woman. &ldquo;I will swear it all&mdash;write down my
testimony&mdash;write it down, I say&mdash;we shall hang side
by side, my brave lord&mdash;all your own handy-work,
my gentle husband!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was followed by a low, insolent, and sneering
laugh, which, from one in her situation, was sufficiently
horrible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not at present hear anything,&rdquo; replied he,
&ldquo;but distinct answers to the questions which I shall
put to you upon this matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you shall hear nothing,&rdquo; replied she sullenly,
and no inducement or intimidation could bring her to
speak again.</p>

<p>Lord Glenfallen&rsquo;s deposition and mine were then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
given, as also those of the servants who had entered
the room at the moment of my rescue.</p>

<p>The magistrate then intimated that she was committed,
and must proceed directly to gaol, whither
she was brought in a carriage of Lord Glenfallen&rsquo;s,
for his lordship was naturally by no means indifferent
to the effect which her vehement accusations against
himself might produce, if uttered before every chance
hearer whom she might meet with between Cahergillagh
and the place of confinement whither she was
despatched.</p>

<p>During the time which intervened between the
committal and the trial of the prisoner, Lord Glenfallen
seemed to suffer agonies of mind which baffled
all description; he hardly ever slept, and when he
did, his slumbers seemed but the instruments of new
tortures, and his waking hours were, if possible, exceeded
in intensity of terror by the dreams which
disturbed his sleep.</p>

<p>Lord Glenfallen rested, if to lie in the mere attitude
of repose were to do so, in his dressing-room, and
thus I had an opportunity of witnessing, far oftener
than I wished it, the fearful workings of his mind.
His agony often broke out into such fearful
paroxysms that delirium and total loss of reason
appeared to be impending. He frequently spoke
of flying from the country, and bringing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
him all the witnesses of the appalling scene upon
which the prosecution was founded; then, again, he
would fiercely lament that the blow which he had
inflicted had not ended all.</p>

<p>The assizes arrived, however, and upon the day
appointed Lord Glenfallen and I attended in order
to give our evidence.</p>

<p>The cause was called on, and the prisoner appeared
at the bar.</p>

<p>Great curiosity and interest were felt respecting
the trial, so that the court was crowded to excess.</p>

<p>The prisoner, however, without appearing to take
the trouble of listening to the indictment, pleaded
guilty, and no representations on the part of the
court availed to induce her to retract her plea.</p>

<p>After much time had been wasted in a fruitless
attempt to prevail upon her to reconsider her words,
the court proceeded, according to the usual form, to
pass sentence.</p>

<p>This having been done, the prisoner was about to
be removed, when she said, in a low, distinct voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A word&mdash;a word, my lord!&mdash;Is Lord Glenfallen
here in the court?&rdquo;</p>

<p>On being told that he was, she raised her voice to
a tone of loud menace, and continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardress, Earl of Glenfallen, I accuse you here
in this court of justice of two crimes,&mdash;first, that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
married a second wife while the first was living;
and again, that you prompted me to the murder, for
attempting which I am to die. Secure him&mdash;chain
him&mdash;bring him here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a laugh through the court at these
words, which were naturally treated by the judge as
a violent extemporary recrimination, and the woman
was desired to be silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t take him, then?&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you
won&rsquo;t try him? You&rsquo;ll let him go free?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was intimated by the court that he would
certainly be allowed &ldquo;to go free,&rdquo; and she was
ordered again to be removed.</p>

<p>Before, however, the mandate was executed, she
threw her arms wildly into the air, and uttered one
piercing shriek so full of preternatural rage and
despair, that it might fitly have ushered a soul into
those realms where hope can come no more.</p>

<p>The sound still rang in my ears, months after the
voice that had uttered it was for ever silent.</p>

<p>The wretched woman was executed in accordance
with the sentence which had been pronounced.</p>

<p>For some time after this event, Lord Glenfallen
appeared, if possible, to suffer more than he had
done before, and altogether his language, which often
amounted to half confessions of the guilt imputed to
him, and all the circumstances connected with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
late occurrences, formed a mass of evidence so convincing
that I wrote to my father, detailing the
grounds of my fears, and imploring him to come to
Cahergillagh without delay, in order to remove me
from my husband&rsquo;s control, previously to taking legal
steps for a final separation.</p>

<p>Circumstanced as I was, my existence was little
short of intolerable, for, besides the fearful suspicions
which attached to my husband, I plainly perceived
that if Lord Glenfallen were not relieved, and that
speedily, insanity must supervene. I therefore expected
my father&rsquo;s arrival, or at least a letter to
announce it, with indescribable impatience.</p>

<p>About a week after the execution had taken place,
Lord Glenfallen one morning met me with an unusually
sprightly air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fanny,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have it now for the first time
in my power to explain to your satisfaction everything
which has hitherto appeared suspicious or
mysterious in my conduct. After breakfast come
with me to my study, and I shall, I hope, make all
things clear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This invitation afforded me more real pleasure
than I had experienced for months. Something had
certainly occurred to tranquillize my husband&rsquo;s mind
in no ordinary degree, and I thought it by no means
impossible that he would, in the proposed interview,
prove himself the most injured and innocent of men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>Full of this hope, I repaired to his study at the
appointed hour. He was writing busily when I
entered the room, and just raising his eyes, he requested
me to be seated.</p>

<p>I took a chair as he desired, and remained silently
awaiting his leisure, while he finished, folded, directed,
and sealed his letter. Laying it then upon the table
with the address downward, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dearest Fanny, I know I must have appeared
very strange to you and very unkind&mdash;often even
cruel. Before the end of this week I will show you
the necessity of my conduct&mdash;how impossible it was
that I should have seemed otherwise. I am conscious
that many acts of mine must have inevitably given
rise to painful suspicions&mdash;suspicions which, indeed,
upon one occasion, you very properly communicated
to me. I have got two letters from a quarter which
commands respect, containing information as to the
course by which I may be enabled to prove the
negative of all the crimes which even the most
credulous suspicion could lay to my charge. I
expected a third by this morning&rsquo;s post, containing
documents which will set the matter for ever at rest,
but owing, no doubt, to some neglect, or perhaps to
some difficulty in collecting the papers, some inevitable
delay, it has not come to hand this morning,
according to my expectation. I was finishing one
to the very same quarter when you came in, and if a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
sound rousing be worth anything, I think I shall
have a special messenger before two days have
passed. I have been anxiously considering with
myself, as to whether I had better imperfectly clear
up your doubts by submitting to your inspection the
two letters which I have already received, or wait
till I can triumphantly vindicate myself by the production
of the documents which I have already mentioned,
and I have, I think, not unnaturally decided
upon the latter course. However, there is a person
in the next room whose testimony is not without its
value&mdash;excuse me for one moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he arose and went to the door of a
closet which opened from the study; this he unlocked,
and half opening the door, he said, &ldquo;It is
only I,&rdquo; and then slipped into the room, and carefully
closed and locked the door behind him.</p>

<p>I immediately heard his voice in animated conversation.
My curiosity upon the subject of the
letter was naturally great, so, smothering any little
scruples which I might have felt, I resolved to look
at the address of the letter which lay, as my husband
had left it, with its face upon the table. I accordingly
drew it over to me, and turned up the direction.</p>

<p>For two or three moments I could scarce believe
my eyes, but there could be no mistake&mdash;in large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
characters were traced the words, &ldquo;To the Archangel
Gabriel in Heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had scarcely returned the letter to its original
position, and in some degree recovered the shock
which this unequivocal proof of insanity produced,
when the closet door was unlocked, and Lord Glenfallen
re-entered the study, carefully closing and
locking the door again upon the outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whom have you there?&rdquo; inquired I, making a
strong effort to appear calm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said he, musingly, &ldquo;you might have
some objection to seeing her, at least for a time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; repeated I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I see no use in hiding it&mdash;the
blind Dutchwoman. I have been with her the whole
morning. She is very anxious to get out of that
closet; but you know she is odd, she is scarcely to
be trusted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A heavy gust of wind shook the door at this
moment with a sound as if something more substantial
were pushing against it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha, ha!&mdash;do you hear her?&rdquo; said he, with
an obstreperous burst of laughter.</p>

<p>The wind died away in a long howl, and Lord
Glenfallen, suddenly checking his merriment, shrugged
his shoulders, and muttered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor devil, she has been hardly used.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We had better not tease her at present with
questions,&rdquo; said I, in as unconcerned a tone as I could
assume, although I felt every moment as if I should
faint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! may be so,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Well, come back
in an hour or two, or when you please, and you will
find us here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He again unlocked the door, and entered with the
same precautions which he had adopted before, locking
the door upon the inside; and as I hurried from
the room, I heard his voice again exerted as if in
eager parley.</p>

<p>I can hardly describe my emotions; my hopes
had been raised to the highest, and now, in an
instant, all was gone: the dreadful consummation
was accomplished&mdash;the fearful retribution had fallen
upon the guilty man&mdash;the mind was destroyed, the
power to repent was gone.</p>

<p>The agony of the hours which followed what I
would still call my awful interview with Lord Glenfallen,
I cannot describe; my solitude was, however,
broken in upon by Martha, who came to inform me
of the arrival of a gentleman, who expected me in
the parlour.</p>

<p>I accordingly descended, and, to my great joy,
found my father seated by the fire.</p>

<p>This expedition upon his part was easily accounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
for: my communications had touched the honour
of the family. I speedily informed him of the
dreadful malady which had fallen upon the wretched
man.</p>

<p>My father suggested the necessity of placing some
person to watch him, to prevent his injuring himself
or others.</p>

<p>I rang the bell, and desired that one Edward
Cooke, an attached servant of the family, should be
sent to me.</p>

<p>I told him distinctly and briefly the nature of the
service required of him, and, attended by him, my
father and I proceeded at once to the study. The
door of the inner room was still closed, and everything
in the outer chamber remained in the same
order in which I had left it.</p>

<p>We then advanced to the closet-door, at which we
knocked, but without receiving any answer.</p>

<p>We next tried to open the door, but in vain; it
was locked upon the inside. We knocked more loudly,
but in vain.</p>

<p>Seriously alarmed, I desired the servant to force
the door, which was, after several violent efforts,
accomplished, and we entered the closet.</p>

<p>Lord Glenfallen was lying on his face upon a sofa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;he is asleep.&rdquo; We paused for
a moment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He is too still for that,&rdquo; said my father.</p>

<p>We all of us felt a strong reluctance to approach
the figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edward,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;try whether your master
sleeps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servant approached the sofa where Lord
Glenfallen lay. He leant his ear towards the head
of the recumbent figure, to ascertain whether the
sound of breathing was audible. He turned towards
us, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lady, you had better not wait here; I am
sure he is dead!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see the face,&rdquo; said I, terribly agitated;
&ldquo;you <em>may</em> be mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man then, in obedience to my command,
turned the body round, and, gracious God! what
a sight met my view.</p>

<p>The whole breast of the shirt, with its lace frill,
was drenched with his blood, as was the couch underneath
the spot where he lay.</p>

<p>The head hung back, as it seemed, almost severed
from the body by a frightful gash, which yawned
across the throat. The razor which had inflicted
the wound was found under his body.</p>

<p>All, then, was over; I was never to learn the
history in whose termination I had been so deeply
and so tragically involved.</p>

<p>The severe discipline which my mind had undergone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
was not bestowed in vain. I directed my
thoughts and my hopes to that place where there is
no more sin, nor danger, nor sorrow.</p>

<p>Thus ends a brief tale whose prominent incidents
many will recognize as having marked the history of
a distinguished family; and though it refers to a
somewhat distant date, we shall be found not to have
taken, upon that account, any liberties with the facts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An inside and intimate picture of Irish life and character, in
phases and circumstances which have not, so far as we know, been
approached by any other novelist or satirist. The work is not
describable, it is not to be indicated by comparison; the very touch
of occasional caricature in the election scenes, and in the &lsquo;brigand&rsquo;
of the story, O&rsquo;Ruark, which throws out the sheer clear actuality of
the people, the places, the &lsquo;ways&rsquo;; the extraordinary humour of the
talk; the jarring of small interests and petty ambitions in the town
that is all the world to its inhabitants; the swift stroke of fate and
sudden investment of the scene with tragic interest&mdash;are Mr.
Downey&rsquo;s own. Mick Moloney&rsquo;s last &lsquo;few words with the master&rsquo;
is an incident worthy to be placed beside the famous death scene in
the mountain-pass in &lsquo;Tom Burke.&rsquo;&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[2]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The only fault we have to find with &lsquo;The Merchant of Killogue&rsquo;
is that it is too conscientious.... In depicting his characters he
shows rare skill and knowledge as well as a very considerable gift
of humour. They are all vivid, distinct, and lifelike.... The
workmanship is of quite unusual merit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no questioning the ability of Mr. Edmund Downey&rsquo;s
Munster tale. It is long since a writer has introduced us to a set
of characters so fresh, so unlike the usual creations of the novelist.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="bc">VANITY FAIR.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every character in the book is put down in words so subtle and
strong that for yourself you know the people. There is nothing of
the new woman in it, and not a line concerning the analyses of soul
and body. It is just a picture of Irish life which might have been
written in shorthand as it happened, and written out afterwards in
longhand, so clear and sharp and vital is it. It is an exciting story,
with a thrilling winding up.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[3]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Before you are half-way through the first chapter of this entertaining

ordinary attention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The plot acts mainly as a peg on which the author hangs his
sketches of Irish character, and these are excellently done. The

<span class="f9">A Novel.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Appleton&rsquo;s new novel is in every way the equal, if it be not
positively the superior of &lsquo;Frozen Hearts,&rsquo; the work which established
his just claims to popularity. It is a capital story, written
in a most natural and graceful style. The plot is interesting, and
all the characters are distinct and realistic creations; some, indeed,
are likely to &lsquo;live,&rsquo; and become by reason of their quaint sayings
and doings, popular, as were in days of yore some of Dickens&rsquo; and
Thackeray&rsquo;s personages. Notably is this the case with John, a most
original and amusing character, whose pithy sayings provoke many
a hearty laugh. The intrigue of the story is lively and intricate,
but so skilfully contrived that the &lsquo;situations&rsquo; never appear forced
or unnatural. &lsquo;Catching a Tartar&rsquo; is worthy of much praise, and is
decidedly one of the cleverest novels we have read or reviewed for<span class="pagenum">[3]</span>
a long time. Mr. Appleton possesses exceptional talent as a novelist,
and, above all, the rare quality of getting to his point without encumbering
his narrative with superfluous matter. He is always
original, and never dull or commonplace. His next venture in the
shape of a novel will be looked forward to with much interest.&rdquo;&mdash;<cite>Morning
Post.</cite></p>

<p>&ldquo;Many able men have come short of being successful novel
writers, simply because they lacked brightness or lightness or
smoothness of composition. Mr. Appleton displays these qualities;
his book is therefore easy to read.... A vein of humour throughout,
the effect of which is heightened by many a touch of genuine
pathos. So marked an advance in the course of a single year is
deserving of note.&rdquo;&mdash;<cite>Athenæum.</cite></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Appleton has here achieved a very decided success in the
way of a novel of mystery. We must, if we are honest, admit that
our attention has been irresistibly enchained throughout the three
volumes. The book is one, altogether, to be read, and we may safely
predict that no one who masters the first fifty pages will be the
least likely to leave it unfinished.&rdquo;&mdash;<cite>Graphic.</cite></p>

skill and spirit.... Characters firmly and sharply drawn, with a
good deal of quiet fun and humour.&rdquo;&mdash;<cite>Guardian.</cite></p>

<p class="bc"><span class="f11">JACK ALLYN&rsquo;S FRIENDS:</span><br />
<span class="f9">A Novel.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Appleton knows how to write novels of absorbing and unflagging
interest and of remarkable cleverness, and his latest effort,
&lsquo;Jack Allyn&rsquo;s Friends,&rsquo; unmistakably possesses these qualities.
Much of the peculiar interest of the story is derived from the
subtlety with which the catastrophe is brought about. But there is
also a brisk, almost boisterous vitality about the book&mdash;a sort of
vigorous simplicity, resembling that of Messrs. Besant and Rice&mdash;with
abundant humour and some cleverly-managed love-making
under difficulties. With all these characteristics, &lsquo;Jack Allyn&rsquo;s
Friends&rsquo; is a novel which even those who may pronounce its condemnation
from the serene heights of æstheticism will read and
enjoy.&rdquo;&mdash;<cite>Scotsman.</cite></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Appleton has succeeded in writing a novel which combines
the merits of Miss Braddon with those of Bret Harte. The plot is
carefully prepared, and the interest sustained until the very close
of the third volume. The stout old American, Bill Hooker, reminds
us of one of Bret Harte&rsquo;s Rocky Mountain heroes, whose hearts are
of the same sterling metal as the ore from their mines.&rdquo;&mdash;<cite>Graphic.</cite></p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt about the interest of this novel. The plot is
certainly contrived with no little art. The secret is ingeniously
kept. Suspicion is skilfully directed, first in one direction, then in
another, and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénouement</i> will probably be unsuspected. A
decidedly readable novel.&rdquo;&mdash;<cite>Spectator.</cite></p>
